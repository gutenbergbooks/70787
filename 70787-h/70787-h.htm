<p>In the summer of 1895 the Afghan prince, Shahzada
Nasrullah Khan, was the guest of the English
Government for three or four months, and he had
been entertained and <i>fêted</i> and generally made much
of while his visit lasted, and his return journey had
been made pleasant by a stay in Paris, Rome, and
Naples before going on by sea to Karachi and thence
by rail to Chaman, the railway terminus close to the
Afghan frontier on the Quetta side of Beloochistan.</p>

<p>The Shahzada was met and entertained at the
railway terminus by General Sir J. Brown, commanding
the Quetta district, with other officers and
officials, and afterwards rode on to his camp across
the border, where he was joined by a multitude of
troops and followers, who had been sent by the Amir
to accompany him on his further journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span></p>

<p>I had accompanied the Shahzada, as he was
commonly called in England, on his return from
London, and rode with him through Kandahar to
Kabul, and when he set out from his camp early
the following day I formed one of his retinue. It
was near the end of October and late in the season,
but the day we started was a very hot one, and grew
hotter as we went on, and the multitude of horsemen
who accompanied the prince caused clouds of dust
to rise as they rode along and made it still more
sultry and oppressive.</p>

<p>The country looked very desolate and inhospitable,
for on all sides stretched a large undulating sandy
plain, bare of vegetation, save a few tufts of coarse
grass here and there, and rocks jutting out of the
plain in places, while in the distance were bare foot-hills
and barren rocky mountains, and over all the
sun threw its burning rays until the sand and rocks
seemed to give out as much heat as the sun itself.
There is no made road from Chaman to Kandahar,
nothing but a track worn into the earth by the passing
of caravans from time immemorial, and at places
on the side of the track were the bones of horses and
camels whitening where they had fallen. The prince
and his retinue, however, rode along cheerfully, for
they had returned safely through all the dangers
of foreign travel and had many tales of strange
lands and stranger customs to tell their relations
and friends when they got to Kabul, and had
brought with them finely wrought produce of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
lands to make presents of and to trade with and
reap much profit.</p>

<p>In front of the Shahzada were two long lines,
wide apart, of Usbeg Lancers. At an interval on
either side of him, and following the Usbegs, were
two other lines of the bodyguard, the Rissalah
Shahi, armed with sword and carbine, and better
uniformed than the others, and following these were
troops of sowars who were roughly dressed and
wild-looking, though not so wild-looking as the
Usbegs with their sheepskin busbies, the hair of
which falls about their faces and makes them look
wilder than nature made them. The sowars’ mode
of keeping line would, perhaps, have offended a
military eye, but they nevertheless looked very
serviceable in case of need.</p>

<p>Before all rode a man with a native drum
strapped to the saddle in front of him, which he
kept continuously tapping in time to his horse’s
hoof beats; this is the custom used to signify the
approach of a royal personage when travelling.</p>

<p>Beside the prince ran a man carrying a huge
gold embroidered umbrella, as a protection from the
scorching rays of the sun, and around him were syces
and foot guards, while a little in front were other syces
leading spare horses. Behind rode attendants and
the Khans and chiefs who were accompanying him,
and I rode with these and knew what it was like
to ride in a cloud of dust which caked the perspiration
on one’s face and was so dense that the horses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
stumbled over stones in the road they were unable
to see.</p>

<p>Along the track, and stretching away into the
distance, both before and behind, were strings of
camels and pack-horses, each with its own dust-cloud
and accompanied by their drivers, who were
on foot. These carried the tents and baggage of
this small army, and with each string of animals
was a sowar, or trooper, whose duty it was to see
that there was no undue delay on the road and to
ensure the full load reaching the next camp, for
most of the pack animals were the property of men
who make a trade of carrying goods, and these men
are not averse to making a little extra profit when
opportunity offers.</p>

<p>It was with a feeling of thankfulness that I heard
the prince order a halt for tea soon after midday,
for my mouth was parched with heat and dust. We
all dismounted by the side of a hillock, and seated
ourselves on the stones and rocks round about while
tea was prepared; excepting, of course, attendants
and soldiers, who are not supposed to feel fatigue.
After drinking tea the prince offered me a cigarette,
and I may mention that he showed me many courtesies
and kindnesses on the journey and ordered fur-lined
overcoats to be made for me by his tailors, saying
that English coats were unsuitable for the extreme
cold we should afterwards experience, and I appreciated
his thoughtfulness in this very thoroughly
afterwards. The Shahzada was a different being in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
his own country, not at all like the Afghan Prince in
London.</p>

<p>After a short rest the march was resumed and
continued until camp was reached. The afternoon’s
ride was more pleasant, for the heat was less, and,
the track running over harder ground, the dust was
not quite so much in evidence.</p>

<p>At all of the villages we passed the inhabitants
were crowded outside the walls to see the Shahzada
and his people, while the head men of the village
stood in front of the others, and, as the prince came
up, took off their turbans with both hands, and prayed
for him and his safe journey. Outside most of the
villages long poles were fixed in the ground on either
side of the track, with a string stretching across from
top to top, and from the centre of the string the
Koran was suspended, wrapped in cloths. The prince
and his followers, when passing under the Koran,
stretched up their right hands and touched it, and
then with that hand touched each of their eyes, their
mouths, and hearts, saying a short prayer the while.
After this the Shahzada would stop for a time and
talk with the head men of the village, and then ride
on. Two or three bands accompanied the party, and
on the prince’s arrival at each camping-ground they
played the royal salute as he rode in (this was also
done when leaving). At each camp also a large
shamiana was ready, and there he would hold durbar,
which all the chief men of the country round about
attended, either to salaam the prince or to receive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
payment for the provisions and forage supplied to
the men sent on in advance to prepare everything
against his coming.</p>

<p>At many of the places stopped at were men
who had come to meet those friends or relations who
had been to England, but it was at Chaman that the
Afghans first got news of their relatives. When first
meeting a friend they embrace three times, first to the
right, then to the left, and then to the right again,
after which streams of question and answer follow.
It was touching to see the eager questions after the
triple embrace, and to see some turn away crying,
possibly at the news of the death of a relative, or it
may have been that they were overcome at meeting
with friend or relative.</p>

<p>While superintending the unloading of baggage
from the goods train at the Chaman terminus, before
crossing the frontier, I noticed the Kotwal, one of
the prince’s staff who accompanied him on his visit to
England, sitting on some boxes and looking very
glum. He knew sufficient Urdu to carry on a conversation,
and so I asked what troubled him. He
sighed, and said that he had just heard that his
brother in Kabul had been made prisoner, and now
his own enemies—may their fathers be cursed!—had
taken advantage of his brother’s downfall to poison
the Amir’s mind against him, and he was told that if
he returned to Kabul it was probable the Amir would
kill him. So he had thought it over, and concluded
that it was better he should go back to Karachi and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
stay there with some friends until he could return
with safety, and he asked me to help him in getting
away by the next train.</p>

<p>To help in the running away of one of the chief
officials of Kabul would have been a bad introduction
for me to the Amir, and it seemed hard not to help a
man to escape death, as he said, and he knew the
Amir’s ways; so, saying I would think it over and
make inquiries about the trains, I left him, wondering
how best to arrange the difficulty. I ascertained that
there would be no train before nightfall, and at that
time we were due at the Afghan camp across the
frontier, so, as there was no necessity to take
immediate steps in the matter, I went on with the
work in hand.</p>

<p>At lunch time the English-speaking native, who
had charge of the catering and other arrangements in
connection with the prince’s reception at Chaman,
came to tell me that the Kotwal had also approached
him about running away, and what should he do? I
recognized that there was no help at hand, and so I
impressed on him that whatever was done nothing
must be known that we were concerned in the man’s
running away, pointing out the bad impression it
would make on the Amir, and that the Government
would no doubt institute inquiries and we should be
blamed. So he went off, and came back with the
Kotwal, and for a long time talked to him in Persian,
of which I had little knowledge then, and, I believe,
persuaded him that it was better that he should go<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
away that day to the Afghan camp, and get back
during the night, or the following day, and he would
leave one of his men to see him to Karachi. However,
when I rode away that evening the Kotwal
rode with me, and we reached the Afghan camp together,
and he was one of the prince’s retinue when
we set out next day on the road to Kandahar.</p>

<p>Afterwards, although the prince received orders in
Kandahar that he should be brought back to Kabul
in chains, the Kotwal made his peace with the Amir,
and continued for some time in the enjoyment of his
position, which included torturing and killing people
in horrible ways, and the acquisition of wealth by
bribery and extortion, so that when he died of cholera
some eight years later he was possessed of several
lakhs of rupees. The day he died, I overheard some
soldiers gloating over the fact that that night his
soul would be roasting in hell, and I fancy some few
thousand others derived consolation from the same
thought, and knowing what I did of him myself, the
fate the soldiers assigned him seemed not an improbable
one.</p>

<p>According to the Afghan theory, the soul of a
man is judged the night of the day he is buried,
hence the delight of the soldiers over what would
take place that night after the judgment had been
pronounced.</p>

</figure>

<p>The camp at each stopping-place looked rather
imposing, and gave the impression of an immense
gathering, as, besides the prince with his retinue and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
soldiers, were the men in charge of the baggage
animals, who of themselves formed a rather large
company, for the camels alone numbered half a
thousand, so that the tents, horses, and camels
covered a large tract of ground. After nightfall all
the fires at which the men were cooking their food
showed up clearly, and each fire had its quota of men
busily superintending the pots and cooking arrangements
generally, while others were standing or
squatting round, watching and waiting the moment
when, all being ready, they might fall to.</p>

<p>The noises of the camp at night were numerous,
though there was never any rowdiness, for an Afghan
crowd is the most orderly and quiet of any country,
but there were the voices of officers giving orders,
the squeals of horses fighting with one that had got
loose (and there always seemed a loose horse about at
night), the gurgling of the camels, the challenges of
soldiers on guard in guttural Afghani, and the striking
of gongs to announce the hour.</p>

<p>I remember one night, or rather early morning,
when the guard over the gong had evidently been
asleep and waked up suddenly, hearing sixteen
strokes of the gong in rapid succession, although it
was only half-past one. Whether this was the result
of nightmare, or whether the man thought a little
extra activity would better demonstrate his extreme
wakefulness, I cannot say.</p>

<p>We were four days reaching Kandahar, for only
on one day was the march at all a long one, the rest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
being what they term “King’s marches,” in contradistinction
to “Caravan marches.” King’s marches
being short ones on account of the number of men,
etc., to move. The distance from one camp to
another is usually expressed as so many hours’
journey. The horses on a journey go at a uniform
pace, something between a quick walk and a jog-trot
to which they are trained, and at which pace they
can, when in condition, cover fifty to sixty miles in a
day, though it is not customary to push them to that
extent except in cases of necessity. Taking into consideration
the mountainous description of country
usually met with, the absence of proper roads, and
the size of the horses (which average thirteen to
fourteen hands), this is a fair distance.</p>

<p>They have a unit of distance in Afghanistan
called a “kro,” which is said by some to be equivalent
to one and a half English miles, but as there are no
recognized number of “guz” (yards) to the “kro” it
assumes varying dimensions, according to individual
taste. I once received a firman from the Amir,
through the prince, to make a perambulating instrument
for measuring roads which was to show distances
on the index in guz and kro, and I wrote the
prince to let me know the number of guz in a
kro that I might arrange the necessary clockwork.
He replied that he had made inquiries, and the
number given by different persons so varied that
he had written the Amir to fix a standard; but the
Amir fell ill just then, and the matter remained in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
abeyance, and the same indefiniteness still exists.
The present Amir has distances measured in yards
and miles.</p>

<p>Once when travelling from Kabul to Peshawar,
and after being seven or eight hours in the saddle, I
asked the sowars with me how far it was to the
village by which we intended camping. One usually
is rather interested in knowing how much farther
one has to go after several hours’ riding. He told
me that it was between one to two kro ahead, but
we did not get to camp until after three hours’ further
riding. So I henceforth made it a custom to inquire
the distance in hours, and found it less disappointing.</p>

<p>On arriving within a few miles of Kandahar, the
prince was met by the General commanding that
district and the principal officers, who dismounted
at a distance from him, and came up with heads
uncovered. When they reached him they kissed his
foot, and then, taking his hand between both of
theirs, placed it on each eye in turn, and kissed it also;
this being the Afghan custom when acknowledging
their chief or swearing allegiance. Near the city
the troops of the garrison were drawn up, together
with the artillery, and the latter fired the royal
salute as the prince rode up. The prince then
inspected the troops, and addressed a few words to
them, after which, followed by all the officers and
officials, he repaired to the musjid for prayers,
while I rode on to the city to find the quarters
which had been allotted to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>The road <i>viâ</i> Kandahar is not one which is often
used when travelling from India to Kabul, the road
from Peshawar through the Khyber Pass being the
direct route, and the journey by that road occupies
about eight days when travelling with little luggage
and doing forced marches, while the route <i>viâ</i>
Kandahar and Ghazni takes three or four weeks.
There are no roads for wheeled traffic, nor are there
any railways, and one must either ride or be carried
in a sort of sedan chair, suspended from the backs
of two horses. The Afghan rulers are greatly prejudiced
against railways, and if one but mentions
such a scheme ulterior designs are at once suspected.
Yet a proper scheme of railways to open up the
country would make it rich and prosperous, and do
away with the present universal poverty and misery.</p>

<p>The Shahzada on leaving Kabul for England
had been sent <i>viâ</i> Peshawar by the late Amir,
and arrangements had been made for him to return
<i>viâ</i> Kandahar, in order that he might see as much
as possible of the country. Since he came from
Russia, a little boy of nine, he had never been more
than a few miles out of Kabul, for the Amir did
not encourage the members of his family to travel
unless of necessity. The Amir also wished him to
stop in Kandahar on his return journey to inquire
into matters concerning its government, because for
many years there had been complaints from the
people of the oppression of the governors and
absence of justice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>I was told, while in Kandahar, that the Amir made
the previous governors, when accepting office, sign a
paper providing that, should they rob or oppress
either rich or poor, they consented to be hanged, and
it was significant that the last three or four governors
had been hanged. The man who was governor when
the prince arrived suddenly fell ill, and died a few
days afterwards, and there were not wanting those
who suggested self-destruction in order to escape
worse happening.</p>

<p>Kandahar is situated in the middle of a fertile
plain, or rather the plain would be fertile if irrigated
and cultivated as it could be; but when I was there,
there was little cultivation or signs of it, although
the rivers carry plenty of water. On account of the
small amount of rainfall in Afghanistan irrigation is
necessary in order to make the land yield crops; and
in some cases, to provide water for land which cannot
be irrigated direct from the river, the people have
sunk a series of wells leading from water-bearing
strata to the land requiring irrigation, connecting
the wells by underground ducts; the water from the
last well being raised to the surface by means of a
Persian wheel. This is a laborious process, and as
the connecting ducts are not arched or protected in
any way, the supply is frequently stopped by the
earth falling in, and crops are ruined before the
supply can be set going again.</p>

<p>I was asked to propose an irrigation scheme by
which the whole of the surrounding land could be put<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
under cultivation, and gave my opinion; but, although
the work was feasible, it involved too great an outlay
for the exchequer, and the matter was dropped.</p>

<p>The city is not a large one, and is surrounded by
a high wall, which, together with most of the buildings,
is built of mud and stone, or mud and sun-dried
brick. The whole place is in a most tumble-down
condition, having been partially destroyed several
times during the wars of the past twenty years and
not rebuilt. It gave one the idea that the inhabitants
were in the utmost poverty, and although some of
the better houses and musjids are built of small burnt
bricks and lime, yet in all is the same appearance of
dilapidation which made one think that the people
were humbled and lacked the heart to put their city
to rights. Some of the streets in the bazars are
raised above the surrounding land, so that one looks
down into the tumble-down shops, where copper, tin,
leather, and other trades are carried on in a small
way.</p>

<p>One thing that struck me particularly when
riding through the bazars was the small size of the
donkeys, which are little bigger than a large mastiff.
They are employed in carrying loads, and I saw many
with such huge piles of grass on them that only the
donkey’s hoofs and a small portion of his head was
visible. Ripe cases for the intervention of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.</p>

<p>I was lodged in a small house, built in the form
of a cross, and consisting of one room only, branching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
out on four sides, this form being, I believe, copied
from Russia. It was situated in the garden adjoining
the house occupied by the prince, and as the weather
was getting cold at night it was a decided improvement
on a tent, although the architect had forgotten to
include a fireplace. From the roof of the house I got
a good view over most of the city, and could also see
the minarets of the musjid in which is a sanctuary
where any man, whatsoever his crime, is safe when
once inside. There used to be similar sanctuaries in
some old English churches.</p>

<p>The late Amir once told me a story of a moullah in
Kandahar who had dubbed him a “Kafir” (infidel)
when inciting the people to rise against him. They
had to make him out a “Kafir,” as otherwise it is
against the religious law for the people to rise
against the King, who is also their spiritual head.
When the ensuing rebellion had been put down the
Amir was told that this man had taken refuge in the
sanctuary. Then the Amir, turning the tables on
the man, said that the sanctuary was for Mussulmans
only, not for such infidels as men who rose against
their king; and, taking his sword, he went to the
musjid and killed the man in the very place. It was
little that stopped Abdur Rahman in the pursuit of
vengeance.</p>

</div>

<p>After spending a few days in the city of Kandahar
the prince went out to a garden a few miles up the
river to spend a couple of days in fishing. On the
evening of our arrival the prince told his suite that
the following day all must appear in Afghan costume,
and that any one who came in English dress would
be thrown into the adjoining river. The river was
a shallow one, so it meant a ducking only. One of
the men there suggested that I should be included,
but was ruled out on the grounds that I wore the
costume of my country. In order to afford amusement
and please the prince, one or two men did go
the next day in English dress, and were ducked,
much to the merriment of all there.</p>

<p>About midday, the weather having cleared, the
prince and the rest of us started up the river, walking
along the banks, while horses were led by syces for
fording branches of the river, or the river itself when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
required. Two fishermen, casting their circular nets
as they went, waded up the river, the party on the
banks keeping well behind them so as not to disturb
the fish before the nets were thrown. The bed of
the river was covered with shingle and stones, with
boulders jutting out here and there, and the water
did not seem to exceed more than four feet in depth
at any place, and, being the time of low water, it was
perfectly clear. There was a good catch of fish, which
in appearance very much resembled trout, some of
them being four to five pounds in weight, but the
flavour of the fish had little to recommend it.</p>

<p>The circular nets used by the fishermen are
similar to those used by natives in India. They
are ten to fourteen feet in diameter, and weighted
round the circumference at short intervals with
leaden pellets, while between the pellets are pockets
into which a fish swimming under the net in an
endeavour to escape gets his head, and his body
too if not a large one, and is so prevented from
escaping. To the centre of the net a long cord is
attached.</p>

<p>The method of using the net is this: the end
of the cord is fastened round the right wrist by a
slip knot and the rest of the cord gathered up in
coils which are held in the right hand. The net
is then held up by the cord so that it may hang
in regular folds, and one half of these folds are
arranged consecutively over the left arm and the
rest over the right, both arms being held out to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
carry them, and care being taken to avoid one fold
entangling with another. The hands grip the folds
nearest them, and then, after one or two preliminary
swings, the net is thrown forward, and outward, in such
manner as to spread out and cover as large an area
as the net is capable of before striking the water.
On striking the water the weighted periphery sinks
at once and encloses any fish within its area.</p>

<p>The principle of landing the fish netted may be
explained by supposing a circular cloth with its
circumference weighted at short intervals spread out
on a table. If the centre of the cloth is taken and
slowly lifted, the circumference of the cloth will drag
in over the table towards the centre until it becomes
massed together just before it is lifted clear. In the
case of the net the weights round the circumference
press against each other sufficiently to prevent fish
falling through while it is lifted clear of the water
on to the bank.</p>

<p>It is no easy matter to use this net without a
good deal of practice, the gathering of the folds over
the arms preliminary to throwing being particularly
awkward, and seeming at first to require three hands
at least. The Afghan fishermen are very expert in
throwing it, and can make it assume circular, oblong,
or triangular shapes, according to the requirements of
the river or stream in which they are fishing and the
rocks and other obstacles it is necessary the net
should avoid when cast. But that is a refinement in
throwing which requires some years’ experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>In nets for catching large fish the weights are
necessarily heavier than those intended for small
ones, but a couple of hours’ fishing with a light net
will be found sufficient exercise for one day for those
not accustomed to them. Those who find it necessary
to fish for the sake of the catch and not for
sport will find these nets useful.</p>

<p>The prince, after spending a couple of days in the
garden, returned to the city, but not liking the house
he had occupied there he went the next day to stop
at the Munzil Bagh, a new palace the Amir had built
a year or so before just outside the city walls. I was
given a tent pitched in the adjoining garden, because
the rooms of the place were large and few, and
sufficient only for the accommodation of the Shahzada
and his personal attendants.</p>

<p>While here, I fell ill with fever and dysentery, and
having no English medicines with me I might have
fared rather badly. The prince, however, on hearing
that I was ill, sent his own hakeem, or doctor, to attend
me, and this man did his best, and gave me every
attention. I was not quite as grateful at the time as
I ought to have been, for three times a day he
brought me medicine in a two-pint glass filled to the
brim with some bitter concoction and sat there while
I drank it, and as part of his treatment was also to
starve me until the disease passed, I felt in rather a
hurry to get better. Towards the end of my illness,
however, I persuaded him to send the medicine to me
and not to put himself to the trouble of bringing it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
and then I found a convenient crack in the dry earth
under my bed which absorbed the bulk of the liquid
better than I could, and I am inclined to think that
taking medicine in the Afghan manner is more or
less an acquired habit. When I was convalescent,
this hakeem selected all food that was to be cooked
for me, and did so in such generous quantities
that, after my enforced fast, I was in danger of
getting ill in other ways. I really ought to have
been more grateful, for he was very conscientious,
and liberal too, and took the greatest interest in
my case.</p>

<p>When I was well again I rode about the country
around a good deal and found plenty of partridge
and quail shooting, and I heard that deer could be
got further away; but as it involved the trouble of
camping out for a night or two I did not think it
worth while to try my luck, and camping out with
a small escort was hardly advisable.</p>

<p>One day I came across an abandoned gold mine,
which I had previously heard the people speak of as
yielding large quantities of gold in its time. A huge
hole had been blasted out of the mountain-side, and
heaps of <i>débris</i> were scattered about, in some parts
entirely filling up previous excavations. The quartz
veins had been mined in all directions, but the gold
had evidently been in a “pocket,” and there was
nothing further to be had. I had a great desire for
an opportunity of thoroughly trying the place myself,
and while I pottered about the sowar escort with me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
broke up lumps of quartz to see what they might
find. Gold exercises a fascination over most
people.</p>

<p>A sowar escort of seven men, with their duffedar
(sergeant), had been appointed to attend me wherever
I went from the day I crossed the frontier, and, as the
penalty, should a fanatic attack and kill me, was death
to themselves, they kept very close to me and left
nothing whatever to chance.</p>

<p>The prince spent about a month in Kandahar and
was getting rather gloomy at the thought of being
kept there for the winter, for it was getting on towards
the end of November, when one evening I went to
pay my compliments, or salaam him, as they call it,
and met him coming into the durbar room as I got
there. I saw that he was very pleased and excited,
and he called out, “How do you do?” (almost all the
English he knew) when he saw me, and shook hands,
which was a thing he seldom did, and then told me
that the Amir’s firman had been received, and he was
to go on at once to Kabul. I made a remark about
it being rather cold weather for travelling, and he
assured me pleasantly that on the march it would be
twenty times colder than in Kandahar. As the water
in my tent froze every night I saw nothing to congratulate
myself upon; however, the prospect of being
on the move again was exhilarating.</p>

<p>That evening the prince had some musicians
brought in. They played upon instruments made of
some sort of cane or bamboo, which rather resemble<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
the flute, and although Afghan music is not usually
soothing to the Western ear, I found the music these
men played rather pleasant and lively. The instruments
they used are peculiar to Kandahar, I was
told, and the prince wanted one of the men to
accompany him to Kabul; but the man was not
attracted by the idea, and managed to evade the
invitation.</p>

<p>The Shahzada left Kandahar the following week,
the intervening time being taken up in preparations
for the journey, although such preparation might
easily have been completed in half the time; but it is
not the habit of the people to rush things. Their
custom is, instead, to put off all they can until to-morrow,
or the day after, that for preference. The
first day’s camp was only twelve miles or so out of
Kandahar, for it is customary always to make the
first day’s march a short one, in order to prepare the
horses and pack animals for the ensuing journey, and
it affords a means of testing the arrangements of the
march generally.</p>

<p>The route to Kabul lay through Khilat, Mukur,
and Ghazni. The road as far as Khilat, which took
four days’ journey, runs in a north-easterly direction,
and mostly alongside the river, which flows down
towards Kandahar from the mountains beyond. The
track rises gradually over a rather flat country, but
there are mountain ranges at a little distance on both
sides. Beyond that to Mukur, another four days’
journey, the road skirts the foot of some mountain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
ranges, and forms a fair road for travelling without
any difficult passes to get over.</p>

<p>From Mukur to Ghazni it runs over a high table-land,
with mountain ranges on either side, which, running
in the same direction, give it the appearance of
an immense roadway. It took four days to cross this
and get to Ghazni, and it was by far the coldest part
of the journey, for the wind was icy, and its keenness
such that it pierced the thickest clothing I had.
Although the sun was bright during the day it had no
warmth, and the surrounding mountains were covered
with snow, but it was not until the day before we
reached Ghazni that snow fell, and made sleeping
under canvas more unpleasant than it had been. It
came on at night, and when I awoke in the morning
I found it covering the boxes in my tent and my bed
too, for the wind had blown the flap of the tent
open and allowed the snow to drift in. It was chilly
dressing before the sun was up, and as my clothes,
which I had thrown over a chair, were also covered
with snow, I had to get dry ones out of my boxes,
the while being lightly clad in a night-suit and
slippers.</p>

<p>That day’s march to Ghazni was a trying one.
Before this the days had been bright and the air dry,
but the moisture given out by the snow made the
wind still more biting, and we had to dismount
occasionally to bring some feeling into hands and
feet, and to rub noses and ears to prevent frostbite.
Many of the Afghans wore hoods shaped like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Balaklava caps which left only the eyes exposed, and
I thought them a very sensible protection against
such severe weather, and wished I had one.</p>

<p>The snow made the ground very slippery, and
many horses fell. The camels were worse off in
that respect than the horses, for their broad flat
feet, which slide in all directions on a wet road, are
ill-adapted for travelling over snow, and, being also
heavily laden, they sooner or later came down, some
of them breaking their legs and having to be killed.
As, however, camel flesh is an article of diet they
were not a literal dead loss to their owners.</p>

<p>Outside Ghazni the Shahzada was met by the
officers and officials there, who brought him presents
of cloth, horses, and money, and when the city was
reached the royal salute was fired by the artillery,
which, with several horse regiments, was drawn up
to receive him. He afterwards went into the city,
where he held durbar for a couple of hours before
coming on to the camp, which was pitched outside
the walls.</p>

<p>Ghazni is situated in a small valley almost surrounded
with low hills. It is a very small place, and
is enclosed by a high wall, as all towns and villages
in Afghanistan are. It has nothing about it to show
that it was once the royal city and the home of
emperors. There are no fine buildings, and its streets
are very narrow and dirty, and the bazars far from
good. It boasts a bala-hisar (high fort) which commands
the surrounding land, but which itself could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
be commanded from the neighbouring heights with
the guns of the present day.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus03" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus03.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>SIRDAR MAHOMED OMAR KHAN AND STAFF.</p>
  <p class="right">[<i>To face p. 24.</i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Up to Ghazni the march was forced in order to
get over the worst part of the journey before the
middle of December, when the heavy falls of snow
usually commence, for the table-land which has to
be crossed before reaching Ghazni is well known
to those who travel that way, and many have been
overtaken by snow and perished there. Consequently
each day’s march was a fairly long one, and one day
was close on forty miles, which for a Shahzada is
looked upon as a good distance. I had been unused
to riding for some months before, and at first was
rather saddle-sore, but soon got hardened.</p>

<p>On some of the longer marches the prince rode
most of the distance on camels, and on those
occasions I went on ahead to escape the dust and
discomfort of the extra pace, for a riding camel’s
trot is very trying to keep up with on horseback.
Being ahead, I was able to trot or canter over the
best bits of road and walk the others, but the disadvantage
of forcing the pace lay in having to wait
three or four hours after reaching camp for the
baggage animals to come in with tents and servants,
and then another hour or so for food to be prepared.
Usually, I got my lunch any time between four
and nine o’clock in the evening, and I found that
waiting about in a bitter wind for several hours
without tent or food was very cold work, particularly
when tired after a long ride. While riding, my feet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
were generally so numbed with cold that they had
no feeling, and in camp in the evenings the coldness
increased to such an extent that water thrown on
the ground froze immediately, and my khansaman
showed me that knives dipped in water came out
with a thin film of ice on them, so that after
nightfall when the wind was at its bitterest, as
the temperature fell lower and lower, one was glad
to get into bed as soon as possible to get warm.</p>

<p>One evening I had a hole dug in the floor of
the tent and a fire made in it, but in less than two
minutes I was outside, coughing, while my eyes were
streaming, and I had to wait outside in the cold
for some time until the wind had cleared the tent
of smoke. After that I got a munkal, or iron dish
that stands on four legs, and had a fire made in that
outside the tent, and when the wood had burnt away
until nothing but glowing cinders were left, I had it
brought inside, and found that it made the place more
comfortable. Before going to sleep, when nothing
but hot ashes were left in the munkal, I used to
put it under the bed, and found a material increase
in warmth there, for I had no mattress, and slept
on rezais (quilted coverlets), which were not altogether
impervious to the icy wind which came in under the
walls of the tent and played under the bed.</p>

<p>We passed several villages on the way, some
perched halfway up a mountain and some in the
valley below, but all surrounded by high walls for
protection. Gardens and cultivated land lay outside<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
the villages, and as we rode past, some of the big
Afghan dogs, which rather resemble a St. Bernard,
would come tearing out, barking, and looking savage
enough and big enough to eat one. They are fierce
brutes, and often try to pull a passing traveller out
of the saddle; but they need be big and savage,
for they are used principally as sheepdogs, and on
occasion have to attack and kill wolves.</p>

<p>The people in the country are mostly robbers,
and in the days before Amir Abdur Rahman took
the country in hand, travellers fared badly, unless
they kept together in bands of thirty or more, for
even poor men travelling alone have been known
to be killed for the sake of the clothes they
wore.</p>

<p>There are many stories told of the treatment
offered travellers by villagers in outlying districts,
and one case was that of a poor man who was going
along carrying a sack on his shoulders, and was seen
by one of these robbers, who, thinking that the sack
must contain something valuable, waited behind a
rock until the man got within range, and then fired
and killed him; but on the robber going over to his
victim, and opening the bag, he found in it nothing
but dried dung (used as fuel by the poor classes),
whereupon, bewailing the waste of his cartridge, he
kicked the body and strode off. I was told of another
case where thirteen men who were travelling during
the winter were stopped and robbed of all they
possessed, the villagers even stripping them of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
clothes they had on, and leaving them to perish in
the cold.</p>

<p>The Amir’s method of putting this sort of robbery
and murder down was simple and effective. If a
man was robbed or killed, all villages within a radius
of about ten miles of the place where the crime was
perpetrated were fined from twenty to fifty thousand
rupees, and if the people failed to pay up promptly,
two or three regiments of soldiers were sent and
quartered on them until payment was effected.
When an Afghan soldier is quartered on any one, he
takes the best of everything in the house, the best
bed, best room, and best food, and if there are no
fowl or sheep the man of the house must procure
them at once, even if he has to sell all he has to
get them. If he does not do this, then the butt
end of a rifle is applied to the small of his back,
or even worse befalls. The villager has no redress,
because it is a Government soldier doing his duty.
In this way the Government fines are paid in as
quickly as possible, for each day’s delay means a
great loss to each house in the village.</p>

<p>The effect of the Amir’s policy was to make each
villager chary of allowing his neighbour to molest
a traveller, as all suffered alike for the crime of one,
and at the time I passed over the road, a single
traveller might go all the way from Kandahar to
Kabul without being unduly troubled. That is, provided
he was not a foreigner, and Persians and
Hindustanis come under that category, for such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
have no friends to make complaints to the Government
and cause bothersome inquiries, and are,
therefore, looked upon as fair sport.</p>

<p>The road from Khilat is fairly level until it nears
Ghazni, when it falls down towards it, and then
beyond Ghazni it rises again over the Darwaza
Ghazni pass, and beyond that falls again towards
Kabul.</p>

<p>Between Ghazni and Kabul, the country, being
at a much lower altitude than that already passed
over, the weather was much milder; but there was
snow on the hills around, and the temperature at
night was below freezing-point. We were five days
travelling over this part of the road, and the country
passed through was rather hilly; but it was well
cultivated in the valleys, and there were many small
villages about.</p>

<p>The road from Chaman to Kandahar, and thence
to Kabul, could readily be made fit for wheeled traffic,
and would offer no difficulties to the construction of
a railway, and the fact that the two heavy siege guns,
presented to the Amir by the Indian Government,
were taken that way and drawn by traction engines
shows sufficiently the ease with which a good road
might be made.</p>

<p>When we arrived at Kila Durani we were only
ten or twelve miles from Kabul as the crow flies,
but had to go on round by the pass some twenty
miles farther on. Close by this village we passed
over one of the English battlefields with mounds of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
stones piled up over those who had fallen. Seated
on one of these mounds of stones I noticed a very
old man rocking his body backwards and forwards
and muttering to himself, and when I had gone on
a little distance I heard one of the soldiers behind
shout, and turning round saw this old man following
me with a huge stone, which he could hardly carry.
The sowars with me laughingly told him that the
Amir Sahib would imprison him if he tried to kill
me; but the old man said that the English had
killed his son and he would kill an Englishman
in return. It was more pathetic than laughable to
see this poor old man gone mad through losing his
son some years before, and carrying a stone he was
unable to throw to take vengeance. It, however,
typifies the character of the people.</p>

<p>When we reached Kila Kazee, which is about
eight miles from Kabul, we had to camp there for
three days so that the prince might ride into Kabul
on the Sunday following, that being an auspicious
day according to the astrologers, who are always
consulted on these matters.</p>

<p>The day we got into camp Sirdar Habibullah
Khan (the present Amir) rode out to see his brother,
and spent the night with him, returning to Kabul the
following day. Sirdar Mahomed Omar also came to
see him, and as he is the son of the Queen-Sultana,
and was about ten years old at the time, the prince
ordered a display of fireworks that night in order to
please him. Sirdar is the title, equivalent to prince,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
conferred on the Amir’s sons only, although the
people use it when addressing other members of the
royal family, as a term of respect.</p>

<p>On the Sunday the prince and his suite rode into
Kabul, dressed in the best they had for the occasion,
and all cheerful at the thought of being home at last.
About halfway a large shamiana was erected, and
here the Shahzada’s son, a little child of two years,
together with the sons of Sirdar Habibullah Khan,
were waiting to meet him. The prince seemed a
good deal affected on seeing his child, which rather
surprised me, as I had always thought him very
unemotional. We spent an hour or so sitting under
the shamiana while tea and refreshments were served,
and then rode on.</p>

<p>Outside the city of Kabul, on an open space close
to the workshops, several regiments and two or three
batteries of artillery were drawn up, and in front of
the troops was Sirdar Habibullah, together with the
General commanding the Kabul troops, and other
officers, who were waiting to receive the prince and
accompany him to the Salaam khana. On the
Shahzada’s approach the guns fired the royal salute,
and then, when the different officers had come up and
saluted the prince, they all rode on together towards
the city. Thousands of people lined the roads to
watch the tamasha, and soldiers were stationed at
intervals to keep the people back and leave a clear
road for the princes and others to pass.</p>

<p>The Amir was holding a public durbar to receive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
his son, safely returned after travelling so far, and on
arrival the prince dismounted at the gate and walked
through the gardens to the Salaam khan, where,
having been announced to the Amir, he walked up the
durbar hall and, kneeling, took his father’s hand in
both his and, placing it on each eye in turn, kissed
it, while invoking blessings and giving the usual
salutations. The Amir, raising the prince, told him
to be seated, and then for the rest of the day there
were rejoicings, and all officials and officers came in
turn to the durbar to salaam the Amir and give
thanks for the safe return of his son.</p>

</div>

<p>On the morning after my arrival, I was walking in
the garden when the court interpreter came to tell
me that the Amir Sahib had ordered that I was to be
favoured with an interview that afternoon. This was
my second visit to Kabul, and I was no stranger to
the Amir, who had the gift of not forgetting any
one he once saw.</p>

<p>The Amir had given orders that I was to be
treated with great honour and courtesy, and the
house in which I had been given quarters was
the new Mihman khana or Guest-house, in which the
Amir himself had been stopping until a few days
before. It is an extensive square building with
large rooms, originally intended for one of the Amir’s
summer palaces, and is situated on the outskirts of
the new city. An extensive garden surrounds the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
house, and the whole is enclosed by a high wall, and
in one of the walls is a covered gateway, on either
side of which are rooms for the use of the outer
guard. Outhouses are built on the inner side of
the wall for the use of the servants, and at the end of
the outhouses is the kitchen, and adjoining that the
hamam (Turkish bath), without which, no large house
in Kabul is considered complete. It was in this
hamam that I had the day before enjoyed the first
comfortable bath since leaving Kandahar.</p>

<p>The hamam consists of two rooms, one opening
into the other, with domed roofs, the floors flagged
with large stone slabs, and the ceilings and walls
plastered with cement. The rooms are heated from a
fireplace built outside, the flue from which branches
out under the inner chamber, and up through the
walls of the outer one. The wall at the fireplace end
of the inner chamber is double, and the intervening
space is occupied by two cisterns, the one for hot
water being immediately over the fire, and the other
for cold water alongside it, and pipes fitted with taps
convey the water to the inner room. The inner
chamber is the hot one, and is used for ablutions,
while the outer one is for cooling down in and
dressing. It is not advisable to spend too much time
in these hamams, as the air, for want of proper
ventilation, is rather foul, and also, as the stone flags
are not too well jointed, the gases from the fire
get in, so that a prolonged visit generally ends in a
bad headache. They are, nevertheless, a great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
convenience in the cold weather, which is much more
severe than the average English winter, but they
take about two days’ firing to get properly heated,
and must be fired every day if wanted for regular
use. Once heated, however, it requires but little fuel
to keep the temperature up.</p>

<p>Accompanied by the translator, I rode off soon
after midday to keep the appointment made by the
Amir, but about halfway to the palace we were met
by a messenger bringing a note. It was from the
Amir, saying, that as he had risen late, he would not
be able to see me at the appointed time, and therefore
told me to come an hour later. To have a letter
putting off the appointment to a later hour is an
extreme mark of honour, for usually when one is
ordered to be present at an appointed time, one has
to sit and wait if the Amir is not ready to receive.</p>

<p>I spent the intervening hour in riding about the
streets and roads on the outskirts of the city, where
the palaces of the Amir and princes are situated, and
where the officials and courtiers and others have their
houses and gardens. This part, which lies to the
north-west of the old city, is generally called Deh
Afghanan, from a small village of Afghan people
which lies in that direction; and here the roads are
broad and well laid out, but at that time they were
not metalled, and after rain or snow, the horses’ feet
sank inches deep in mud and slush, and pedestrians
had to walk warily. At the present time the
principal roads round Kabul are metalled, and riding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
or walking is not the mud-besplashing process it
once was.</p>

<p>The people met with were unwashed and unkempt
in appearance. Even those who were apparently high
in rank, and came along the road on horseback, with
five or six servants running beside them, looked as
though they had washed their faces just before
leaving the house, and had forgotten to wash their
necks. The clean, fresh look of those who bathe
regularly was missing, and, although I found afterwards
that the better classes bathe but once a week
or less, and the others once in a few months, it may,
perhaps, be the dark sallow skin of the neck which
gives the unwashed appearance. Also the dress of
the people being part English and part Afghan, and
their habit of putting on a clean shirt once a week
only adds to the appearance of untidyness, and makes
them look as though a good all-over scrubbing would
do them good.</p>

<p>The Amir was stopping in the Boistan Serai, a
small palace built outside the gardens which surround
the fortified palace of Arak, and alongside the
Queen-Sultana’s palace, which is called the Gulistan
Serai. Boistan and Gulistan both signify garden, the
translation of the former being “place of scents,”
and the latter, “place of flowers.” Kabul itself
might be termed “boistan” in another sense, which
a ride through its bazars would indicate.</p>

<p>On my arrival, with the interpreter, at the gate of
the palace, the captain of the guard there conducted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
us to an inner court, where we waited while the Amir
was informed by the officer on duty that I was
present; and on the Amir ordering that I was to be
admitted, they conducted me into his presence.</p>

<p>On entering the audience chamber I saw the
Amir seated on the side of the couch he used as a
bed. He was dressed in an English grey tweed suit,
and on his head was the Afghan silk fez, with the
royal diamond star at the side of it. The Amir
suffered a good deal from gout, and preferred the side
of his bed for sitting on, as being more comfortable
than a chair, and also, if not feeling well, he was able
to stretch himself on the bed, and rest himself,
without the trouble of first getting up from a chair.</p>

<p>In appearance the Amir looked about forty-five
years of age, although nearer sixty, and this was due
to his hair and beard being died black, making him
look younger than he was. In person he was very
stout and broad, with a rather long body, and short
legs. His eyes were very dark, almost black, and
looked out from under his heavy brows with quick,
keen glances, while in complexion he was sallow, but
his skin was not darker than the average Portuguese.
The Amir had a full set of false teeth, and these he
would take out at times and polish with his handkerchief,
while continuing to speak, but the difference in
his pronunciation made it difficult to follow him. He
once handed his teeth to me to examine, and explained
that one of his own men had made them for
him, having learnt the art from an English dentist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>Around the Amir were slave boys ready to attend
his least want, and in front of him, standing round
about the room, were officers and officials, and
at the door were two men of the royal bodyguard
with bayonets fixed, while the captain of
the guard, carrying an unsheathed sword, stood by
them.</p>

<p>The audience chamber was a large one, and the
floor was covered with fine Persian carpets, but it was
bare of furniture, save the velvet-covered armchairs
and small round-topped tables which were ranged at
intervals along the wall round the room. On the walls
were oil paintings representing landscapes only, for
figure paintings are not allowed in a room where
prayers are said, and this applies to all rooms, for
Mussulmans say their prayers wherever they may
happen to be, and the reason for this is, they say,
that to pray before a pictured figure would give the
appearance of idolatry.</p>

<p>Walking up the durbar room I stood before the
Amir, and bowed; and he asked, according to the usual
greeting, if I was well, and took off his glove to shake
hands (the gout in his right hand necessitated his
wearing a glove in cold weather), saying that it was
not etiquette among the English to shake hands
with gloves on, and then, after the many salutations
usual in Persian, he told me to be seated, and thereafter
talked to me for several hours, and told me
anecdotes of his career and life in Russia, and
generally showed me honour in the gracious courtly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
manner he could so well assume when it pleased
him.</p>

<p>After sitting down, a small table was placed near
me, and tea, fruit, and cigarettes were brought in.
My tea was served in a Russian cup, which consisted
of a glass tumbler fixed in a gold holder
with handle, and carried on a gold saucer, a fashion
the Amir had adopted from the Russians.</p>

<p>When with the Amir on an occasion like this, it
was unnecessary to talk one’s self. The Amir did all
the talking, and all he required of one was to listen
and answer shortly, except when some matter required
full explanation, and then he would listen
very attentively. In relating anything humorous
he would laugh very heartily, sometimes rolling on
his bed, but, whether serious or laughing, the Amir
was always the king, and there was that about him
which forbade any one taking advantage of his
humour. When roused to anger his face became
drawn, and his teeth would show until he looked
wolfish, and then he hissed words rather than spoke
them, and there were few of those before him who did
not tremble when he was in that mood, for it was
then that the least fault involved some horrible
punishment. It was also in these moods that the
Amir would remember the former offences of those
whom he had marked down for punishment, and he
would take advantage of any trifling neglect of
duty or other small offence to inflict a heavy
punishment, so that the feelings of those present<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
on these occasions may be imagined, for none knew
what the Amir had in his mind against them on
account of former misdemeanours.</p>

<p>When in the Amir’s presence no one ever ventured
to speak unless asked a question, or else they caught
his eye and received an inquiring look and the
upward nod of interrogation characteristic of him.
The page-boys moved about quietly and noiselessly
in the execution of their duty, coming in and going
out as they wished, but always careful that several
of their number remained near the Amir.</p>

<p>While I was with the Amir, Sirdar Nasrullah
Khan, whom I had accompanied from London, came
in, and, after salaaming his father, was told to take
a chair. A chair was always offered to either of
his elder sons when they came to visit him, as they
did most days if only for a short time, excepting
on those occasions when they were in disgrace or
the Amir in a bad humour, and then they were not
asked to take a seat, and had to remain standing.
When the younger princes visited him they would
stand behind his chair or couch and act as the
ordinary page-boys did, handing him anything he
wanted, and waiting on him generally. When the
princes wanted to go away they would again salaam
their father and walk out, no permission being asked
or required.</p>

</figure>

<p>To be allowed to sit in the Amir’s presence is a
sign of great favour and an honour accorded to few,
and chiefs and high officials when asked to sit down,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
would do so on the floor, sitting with their backs
against the wall, and if many were present they
would sit in a line along the wall on either side
of the Amir, those highest in rank or favour being
nearest him.</p>

<p>After spending some hours with the Amir, I
asked permission to leave, and as I stood up to go
he told me I was to come to him the next day, and
very often after that, for he wished to see much of
me. His asking me to come often was another
mark of extreme honour, and showed that I enjoyed
great favour, and there is nothing an ambitious
man in that country covets so much as being
allowed often in the Amir’s presence, and there is
a good deal of scheming done to be able to do so.
For one thing, it is a sign of the highest favour
and confidence, and for another all men regard
that man as one to be fawned on and flattered;
and although he may be hated by the envious,
he is also feared, and becomes a man of consequence.</p>

<p>The next two months or so I spent in the
Mihman khana (Guest-house), occupying myself in
preparing a scheme for the development of the resources
of the country, which the Amir had asked
me to write. He was good enough to give me very
high praise for it, but very few of the proposals
embodied in the scheme were carried out. I also
rode a good deal about the surrounding country,
and through the bazars of the city, for there is
little else to do as a means of recreation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>Kabul is situated in the midst of a large valley,
surrounded with mountains at distances varying
from fifteen to twenty miles. The small ranges of
hills, which rise up out of the plain here and there,
give a broken-up appearance to the country, so
that the whole of the valley is not discernible
except from a height. One of these ranges, the
Sher Darwaza (Lion of the gate), is immediately
south of the city, and on the west rise the Asman
Heights. Between the two the Kabul river flows,
coming from the south-west. Along the crest of
the heights is an old wall, mostly in ruins, and
built in the usual way of mud and stone. It follows
the undulations of the summits, and running down
to the pass through which the river flows, it rises
up again and winds along the heights on the opposite
side. Formerly, the wall crossed the river by means
of a brick bridge, but there is nothing to be seen
of the bridge now except the ruined abutments.
This wall was built many years ago as a protection
against the raids of the wild tribes inhabiting the
country south-west of Kabul, who frequently fell
upon the city in great numbers, putting the people
to the sword and carrying off all the loot they could
get, including women and cattle, both of which are
looked upon in much the same light in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>The country round Kabul is well cultivated, and
as there is little rainfall irrigation is resorted to for
watering the crops. Trees have of late years been
planted along most of the roads leading from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
city, and some are to be seen in the walled-in gardens
which dot the plain here and there, but on the hills
round about the absence of trees and vegetation makes
them look very bare and desolate by contrast.</p>

<p>The city contains some hundred and fifty to
a hundred and sixty thousand inhabitants, and, like
all other cities in the country, is walled-in. On the
north-west side the city has overgrown itself, and here
the palaces of the Amir and princes and houses of
the officials and well-to-do people are built. Deh
Afghanan, which gives its name to the new portion
of the city, also lies on this side, and is yearly growing
larger, for all who can leave the old portion of the
city do so, and build houses and live in the fashionable
quarter.</p>

<p>The streets of the city are narrow and winding,
and are mostly paved with round cobble stones of
varying sizes and badly laid, and in the interstices
between the stones a horse sometimes gets its hoof
and lames itself. The roadways are sloped from the
houses on either side towards the centre for the purpose
of drainage, and refuse is thrown out into the
street from the houses, and lies where it falls and rots,
so that the stench on occasions when there is little
wind is particularly trying.</p>

<p>The houses and shops are built of sun-dried brick
and clay, with flat roofs formed of timbers stretching
from wall to wall which are covered with grass mats,
over which a thick layer of clay is laid. The floors
of the rooms are of the same materials, and the houses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
are small and packed close together. The upper stories
of the houses in the wider bazars jut out over the
streets, the ends of the overhanging beams being supported
by wooden struts. In the narrower streets the
upper stories cover the road entirely, forming dark
crooked passages of unpleasant odour through which
it is best to pick one’s way with a light. The widest
bazars are about fifteen feet in width, and the narrowest
about four feet, and as pack horses and camels carrying
loads are to be met with all over the city, it is
often a matter of difficulty to avoid being swept out
of the saddle when riding past them. The strings of
loaded camels are worse than the pack-horses in this
respect, for the camel has no thought for others, and
sticks to the middle of the street, its load projecting
far on either side, and necessitating a horseman
stretching himself flat along the back of his horse
to get past, and it is in the narrowest part of a bazar
that one meets these obstructions more often than
not.</p>

<p>Streams of water led from a higher level up the
river run alongside the street through most of the
bazars for the use of the inhabitants. The water is
good enough where it enters the city, but as it goes
on it gathers impurities of all sorts. Refuse and filth
from the houses find their way into it, people sit and
wash themselves in it, and dead bodies, too, are washed
in the same stream without thought of the disease
which caused death. By the time the water reaches
the Bala Hisar side of the city its quality may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
imagined, and yet this is the water the inhabitants
have to use for drinking and cooking purposes. In
cholera and other epidemics it is in that portion of
the city which the water reaches last where the
disease rages most, and no doubt it is the washing
of the bodies of people dead of the disease in the
same water used by others for drinking which accounts
for a good deal of the spread and long stay of those
epidemics which visit Kabul periodically and carry off
so many thousands of its inhabitants.</p>

<p>Shortly before Amir Abdur Rahman’s death he
instituted a system of latrines in the city with
donkeys to carry away the soil, selling the latter
to those cultivators who required it. This did much
to sweeten the city, but as all private houses could
not be included in the scheme because only the larger
houses have refuse-shoots built up against the outside
wall whence the soil could be carried away, and no
strange man may enter a house where women are,
there was still a good deal left to be desired. The
present Amir, during the cholera epidemic of 1903,
had all the streets of the city swept and cleaned daily
by an army of sweepers, and this was a step in the
right direction, but with the necessity for cleanliness
removed orientals soon fall back into their happy-go-lucky
habits.</p>

<p>With the quantity of refuse thrown out of some
thirty thousand houses daily the city of Kabul would
soon become impossible to live in, but for the
scavenging work done by the dogs and crows, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
are the unconscious remedy of the evil, and prevent
the city becoming uninhabitable. I was told that
one of the former Amirs had all bazar dogs killed,
and the occasion was remembered, because soon afterwards
a bad epidemic of cholera visited the city. The
present Amir also gave orders for all bazar dogs to
be killed, and the bulk of them were despatched, and
then a few months later the cholera epidemic of 1903
broke out and was noted for its virulence.</p>

</div>

<p>Each kochee or bazar in Kabul (streets with or without
shops are called bazars) has a kilantar or headman
whose duty it is to report to the Kotwal (city
magistrate) all births and deaths in his street, keep
order among the inhabitants, see that the street is
kept clean, and to govern it generally; and he is
held responsible for any lawlessness that occurs.</p>

<p>Soon after the death of the late Amir there were
many robberies in different parts of the city, and all
efforts to trace the thieves were unavailing. In some
cases a man who shut up his shop and house and
spent the night with a friend would return home in
the morning to find the whole contents of the shop
looted. So many similar cases occurring it was evident
that the thieves were well informed of the movements
of the householder they intended robbing. In other
cases the owners were awakened by the noise made,
and in an endeavour to protect their property were
wounded or killed by the thieves, and, at last, the
inhabitants were in a state of terror, while in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
bazars nothing was talked of but the robberies and
murders. The Amir was petitioned, and he offered
a large reward to any one giving information of the
robbers, but without result.</p>

<p>Eventually, a shopkeeper who was sleeping, as is
usual at night in fine weather, on the roof together
with one of his relatives, both with swords on account
of the fear prevailing, was awakened by two of the
robbers stumbling over him after climbing up to the
roof from the outside. He sprang up and raised an
outcry, and his relative jumping up too, they made
at the robbers with their swords; but the latter, firing
their pistols at them, ran off. The shopkeeper, although
wounded, ran after them and managed to cut one of
the men across the arm with his sword and then seized
him, and in the struggle that ensued continued to call
for help, until at length some neighbours hurried in
and helped him to secure the thief. The relative,
however, lay dead, shot through the heart. In the
morning the robber was taken to the Kotwal who, by
the Amir’s order, applied different tortures in order to
make him confess the names of his confederates. Some
thirty names were so obtained, and the men were
caught and made prisoners, and among them was
a kilantar (headman) and one or two Kotwali sepoys
(police). The latter, by giving the password of each
night to the gang, had enabled them to pass the street
guards without question, and made it easy for the
robbers to visit any house they desired, and get back
to their own houses before daybreak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>The houses where the stolen goods were stored
were also made known, and a large quantity of
jewellery, carpets, shawls, copper utensils, and other
articles were obtained, from which any of the persons
robbed were allowed to take those articles belonging
to them on giving proof of ownership. Of the robbers,
five were blown from the gun, some were blinded,
and the others were imprisoned for life.</p>

<p>In Kabul a bugle sounds the “wardi” between
eight and nine o’clock every night from each police
station, and it is sounded again in the morning at
sunrise. Between those hours no person is allowed
to go about the streets without giving the password
for the night, and should any one be found
who is unable to do so, he is detained in the guard-room
until morning, when he is taken before the
Kotwal, who fines or releases him according to the
quality of the excuse given.</p>

<p>The bazar shops are very small, the greater
number of them being about a huckster’s stall in
size. The front of the shop is open, and at night
it is shuttered and padlocked. There are no glass
doors or windows, for glass is too rare and costly
except for the Amir’s palaces. The plinth of the
wall projects in front of the shop into the street,
and on this the shopkeeper sits, with his goods
ranged on the floor and shelves of the room behind
him. The goods offered for sale are principally
grain, fruit, vegetables, sugar, and other provisions,
cloth and cotton goods, shawls, boots, and articles of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
apparel, leather goods, copper, tin, and iron utensils,
etc. There are tea shops where a man can get a
small pot of tea for less than a halfpenny, but if
he takes sugar with it he has to pay about a farthing
extra.</p>

<p>In the bazars are also letter-writers, for the use
of those who cannot write themselves, who charge
a halfpenny to a penny for each letter written, the
stamp, of course, being extra. The principal bazars
are named after the article mostly sold there; such
as Gandam Farosh (wheat bazar), Zaghal Farosh
(charcoal), Kunah Farosh (old curios), etc. Revolver
and rifle cartridges can be obtained also, but are
expensive, ranging from two to four cartridges for
a shilling, according to size and demand.</p>

<p>The better-class houses are usually built of
sun-dried brick and mud; there is a good deal of
wood-work about them, and sometimes the whole
front of a house is built up of wood. There are
two parts to each house. The inner part is the
harem serai, where the women are quartered, and
here the rooms are built in such form as to surround
and look out upon an inner courtyard; and an
outer small house, which is built over the gate of
the harem and overlooks the street, for the use of
the man, and where male visitors are received and
entertained by him. The largest houses have also
a garden attached to them, which is surrounded by
a high wall to insure privacy when the women walk
in it, for no woman must allow her face to be seen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
by any man excepting only her nearest relations.
The door leading to the women’s quarters in all
houses has a kopchee or door-keeper, and no one
is allowed to enter any house until its master has
given permission, and no woman is allowed to leave
the house unless the kopchee has been told by the
master to permit it.</p>

<p>The palaces of the Amir and princes are the only
well-built houses in Kabul. The Amir’s principal
palace is Arak. Arak signifies “fort” in Turki, and
“palace” in Persian. It is a large fortified place,
some five hundred yards square, and is surrounded
by a deep and wide moat. The surrounding walls
are double and very thick. The outer walls are
loop-holed for cannon and Maxims, while an earthen
embankment, carried on arches connecting the two
walls, is sloped up from above the embrasures to
the inner wall, the top of which is slotted for riflemen.
Under this embankment are the rooms where
the guns are worked. Inside the fort offices and
storerooms are built up against the inner walls,
together with rooms for the men of the garrison
who form the Amir’s bodyguard, and are specially
selected and highly paid. In the Arak fort are also
the public and private treasuries, and all the modern
rifles and cartridges, of which there are many thousands,
are kept in the storerooms there. The Amir’s
palace inside Arak, and the harem serai for his women,
are both surrounded by a high wall, which forms an
inner defence when so required, and besides these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
are other rooms for the Amir’s use, which have
lately been built alongside the north tower, and at
other places inside the fort. The inner area of
the fort is laid out as a garden, and at one end
of the garden is a large glass-covered hothouse
where the Amir sits very often in winter, surrounded
by shrubs and flowers, and with bulbuls
and other singing birds in cages suspended from the
roof.</p>

<p>Outside Arak are situated the Boistan and Gulistan
palaces. While of the summer palaces, Shahrara
(city’s adornment) lies about a mile to the north-west
of the city, and a couple of miles further on
lies Baghibala (high garden), which was the late
Amir’s favourite summer palace and where he died.
More to the west, and about eighteen miles out of
the city, is the summer palace at Paghman, a green
spot at the foot of the Hindu Kush mountains.
South of Kabul, and about one and a half miles
from the city, is Baber, where another summer residence
has been built beside the tomb of Baber Shah,
the first of the Moghul emperors, who was buried
there in 1530. Six miles out in the same direction
is Hindeki, where the present Amir has a summer
palace, which he used before coming to the throne.
A little to the south-west of Hindeki lies Kila
Asham Khan, where the summer palace of the
Queen-Sultana of the late Amir is situated.</p>

<p>In the gardens outside Arak are two large salaam
khana (audience chambers) which were built by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
late Amir to afford room for large public durbars.
These, in addition to the audience chambers proper,
have smaller rooms attached to them, and the late
Amir was in the habit of spending several days
together in the new salaam khana, which is a handsome
building.</p>

<p>The Kabul climate is a good one, and very
bracing. Situated as it is some seven thousand feet
above sea level, the air is rare, and it is, of course,
much colder than other places on the same latitude.
At first, one experiences a little difficulty in breathing
when walking uphill, and is inclined to doubt the
efficiency of one’s lungs, but this wears off afterwards.
I once climbed up the Hindu Kush to the limit of
the snow in summer, and found the air very exhilarating
and fresh; but I had to stop frequently to
recover breath, and the air I breathed seemed altogether
insufficient and not satisfying, like that at
a lower altitude.</p>

<p>Although there is usually very little rainfall,
during two of the summers I spent in Kabul,
thunder storms, with heavy downfalls of rain, were
frequent. In these storms the flashes of lightning
were almost continuous and the peals of thunder
were deafening, and without cessation; but the
electricity was expended on the heights close to
the city, and there are very few cases on record
of a house being struck.</p>

<p>In the winter heavy falls of snow are common,
and when the wind drifts it, the smaller houses are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
sometimes covered. After a fall of snow, hazara
and other labourers are called in with their wooden
shovels to clear it off the roofs, as it would otherwise
melt when the sun came out, and, percolating the
mud covering, make the rooms below uninhabitable,
and the added weight of snow is often the cause of
a roof falling in. The snow is shovelled off the roofs
into the streets below, where it piles up and takes
months to melt, and keeps the roadway near by in
a muddy condition; but the Afghan cares nothing
for a little extra mud or dirt, and no one takes the
trouble to clear away snow which will melt away
itself in time—that would indeed be wasted labour.
Latterly, arrangements have been made for carting
it away from the principal thoroughfares, and in time
the people may see the advantage of clearing all
thoroughfares alike.</p>

<p>When the summer is dry, dust storms are of
almost daily occurrence, and are very unpleasant
when one is out walking or riding, and in the house
it is also unpleasant, for all doors and windows have
to be kept shut, and the rooms become very hot,
and everything one touches has a gritty feel. In hot
weather the air is usually still until about three in
the afternoon, and then a wind rises, blowing from the
north, and, coming in gusts and eddies downwards,
lifts up columns of dust so effectively that in a short
time it is difficult to see, and this wind continues to
increase in violence until about an hour after sundown,
when it gradually dies away, and then, in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
stillness that follows, the noises of the night sound
very loud.</p>

<p>The winter of 1901-02 was an exceptional one,
for no snow fell the whole of the winter. I was
told of a similar winter about twelve years before,
which had been followed by cholera, and in this case
history repeated itself, for in the spring the rivers
and streams from the mountains dried up, the crops
failed for want of water, and famine set in, and in
the summer following, when food was scarcest,
cholera broke out and raged for three months, and
owing to the impoverished bodies of the people, the
mortality was exceptionally high.</p>

<p>During the winter the days are mostly bright,
and the sun shines brilliantly on the snow, causing
it to thaw. In the evenings it freezes again, and
then the roads are like polished glass, and men,
horses, and camels fall and are injured, the animals
often breaking their legs and having to be destroyed.
The sun, shining on the snow, also causes a good
deal of snow blindness. But the most trying time
in winter is when the skies are overcast, and a great
wind rises which nothing will shut out of the house.
Then at sundown the temperature falls below zero,
and continues to fall as the night advances, and even
with a huge fire burning in the room, one is warm
only on the side nearest the fire, the other side of the
body being chilled with the continuous draught
which comes in at every crevice as the wind surges
against the house in seeming heavy waves. Those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
outside who have to bear the brunt of this wind,
suffer considerably, and often lose feet, hands, or nose
with frostbite, and soldiers on guard frequently die
of cold, for they are very insufficiently clad to stand
such weather. At this time, too, wolves come down
at night from the mountains, driven by hunger from
their natural fastnesses to seek food near the city,
and attack and kill men whom they find helpless
with cold and fatigue, and carry off children, sheep,
and goats when they can get them.</p>

<p>One peculiarity about the climate is the quantity
of electricity in all things. If one walks across a
room in the dark, dragging the feet along the carpet,
sparks of electricity follow the feet; also, if one
strokes a dog smartly down the back, the same thing
is noticeable. When undressing, the shirt, as it is
pulled over the head, causes a crackle of electricity
as it drags over the hair, and women, when brushing
their long tresses, find each hair electrified and
standing out straight from one another as the brush
leaves it.</p>

<p>The clear, rare air makes distances very deceptive
to the eye, and mountains at a considerable distance
appear quite close. Once, when riding one of the
longest day’s journeys I have done in the country,
I was told in the morning that we should camp
under a conically-shaped mountain in the distance,
which could be seen rising between the dip of two
ranges of mountains, and, looking at it, I put the
distance down at twenty to twenty-five miles, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
looked forward to early lunch that day; but evening
was well advanced before we reached our camping-ground,
and we travelled at a steady pace the whole
of the day.</p>

<p>The clear atmosphere also makes the moonlight
very brilliant, and the effect of the sleeping city
bathed in the white light of the moon as seen from
the roof of the house at night, the harsh outlines of
houses and mountains toned down, and the domes
of palaces and tombs rising above the other buildings
is very beautiful. Day dispels the illusion, for the
clear atmosphere and absence of vapour makes the
colouring of the landscape very dull, and the brilliant
green of the trees here and there appears objectionable
as out of keeping with the rest of the colour
scheme.</p>

<p>Speaking generally, there is much in the daily life
and customs of the Afghans that reminds one of
England some three hundred years ago as depicted
in books and histories, such as their superstitions,
their treatment of sick persons by barber surgeons
and leech wives, their belief in ghosts, devils, and
fairies, in fortune-tellers, in people with the evil
eye, in the astrologers who cast their horoscopes,
and their fervent belief generally in the supernatural.
In many other particulars also they
resemble the old English, but in character they differ
considerably.</p>

<p>The dress of the country is of course the Afghan
costume, which consists of tombons or loose pyjama
trousers made of many yards of cotton material
which hang in folds from the hips, round which they
are tied with a pyjama string, a plain shirt which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
is worn outside the tombons, and over the shirt
an armless coat (very much like a waistcoat) which
is usually worn unbuttoned; a large sheet of calico
is worn loosely round the neck like a shawl with
one end carelessly thrown over the shoulder. The
turban is the conical fez, with lungi wrapped tightly
round it over the head, and the shoes more resemble
slippers in shape, they are very heavy and studded
with nails while the toes curl up over the foot.
Stockings or socks are only worn by the well-to-do
people.</p>

<p>Officials and those attached to the court, together
with officers of the army, wear the English style of
clothes, those attached to the court having long frock-coats
similar to the Turkish, and wear fez of black
cloth which are straight, instead of sloping up to the
crown like the ordinary Turkish fez. Officers of the
army wear uniforms fashioned after the style of
the English army with flat peaked caps of the
German pattern.</p>

<p>The soldiers are dressed variously, some wearing
the Afghan tombons and others English trousers, or
white cotton pants cut in the same style, but all
have English pattern tunics or coats, and a leather
belt carrying pouches strapped round the body.
For head-dress, some wear the usual turban and
some flat peaked caps. Soldiers may, in fact, dress
as they like or can, except on review days, when
their uniform (they have but one) must be worn.
The soldiers of the Amir’s bodyguard have uniforms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
for everyday wear, and all are dressed and armed
in the same style.</p>

<p>Most of the people who possess a horse wear
long Russian boots with high heels, which give a
perched up appearance to the legs; but whatever
style of dress may be worn there is always a leather
belt strapped round the body, in which knives and
revolvers are carried, provided the man is fortunate
enough to possess a revolver. Merchants who travel
up and down between Kabul and India buy up
stocks of old uniforms; these are much prized by
the poorer Kabulis, for they wear well and are cheap,
so that one sees all sorts of British regimental tunics,
besides those of the police and railways, and it looks
strange to see a man walking along the street with
the letters “S. E. Ry,” or those of another railway
company on his collar, so many miles away from the
place where it was first worn. Generally the Kabuli
wears clothes made after the English fashion, and
those who cannot afford a good sort of material for
their dress do the best they can, and are to be seen
with the tombons and shoes of the Afghan, and an
English coat, or a suit cut in the English style, and
Afghan shoes, and no socks or stockings. When I
speak of the English coat or trousers, I do not mean
that the clothes are English made, for the bazar
tailors are clever enough to imitate the English
style sufficiently well to satisfy their patrons, and
the tailor who can cut clothes to fit well is in great
demand, and soon becomes a well-to-do person.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>In complexion the people vary considerably, some
being very dark skinned, and others as fair as
Europeans. Those with dark skins are, as a rule,
Kabulis who have no objection to marrying the
women of southern nations, but the true Afghans
from the hills are very fair, and often with light-coloured
hair, and as they despise women of other
nations they seldom marry any but those of their own
people. In many of the Afghans red cheeks give a
greater impression of fairness. Usually the hair is
black, and hangs straight and lank, and men whose
hair and beard go grey from old age or other reasons,
but who feel young enough to take other wives to
themselves—for they marry as many as they can
support—dye their hair and beard a deep black, but
as the dye is not permanent it has to be frequently
renewed; otherwise it fades, and the hair and beard
become a dirty red and look very unprepossessing.
This is often seen in men whose continued duty, or
journey to some distant place, prevents them seeking
the services of their hairdresser, who is usually one of
the women of the household. It is only very old
men indeed who are seen in Kabul with grey hair
and beards, for personal vanity is one of the leading
characteristics of the Afghan, and this influences him
to spend more than he ought on dress in order to
appear well, the food for himself and family being
of diminished quantity in consequence, very often,
indeed, near to starvation point. I have known well-dressed
men who lived chiefly on dry bread, and not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
too much of that, in order to save the bulk of their
income for new clothes.</p>

<p>It has been said that the Afghans are the Lost
Tribes of Israel, and there is much in the appearance
of the true Afghan to support this theory, and in
character and name also. The hooked nose, deep-sunk
piercing eyes, and general features are distinctly Jewish,
while those who have had business relations with the
Afghans will vouch for the character, and then the
names, Suleiman, Yakoob, Yusef, Daood (Solomon,
Jacob, Joseph, David), etc., are common names.
Some mountains in the country also have Jewish
names, such as the Koh-i-Suleiman, so that one is
inclined to think that if they are not the Lost Tribes,
they must be of Jewish origin.</p>

<p>The Kabulis are hybrid creatures, compounded of
many races, and generally having the worst characteristics
of each. In complexion they vary considerably,
but, as a whole, are fair as compared with the
Hindustanis, and some have grey and blue eyes and
light hair. Among them are those of villainous
countenance, and others just as handsome, both in
face and form. They are generally short of stature,
as compared with the Afghans, who are tall and
well-built men; but the conditions of life among the
hillmen are such that the weakly die young, and
it is a case of the survival of the fittest, which, so
far as the physical effect on the race is concerned, is
worthy of emulation by other races.</p>

<p>The Kandaharis are also a good type of Afghan,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
and are mostly strong well-built men. Grey and blue
eyes are common amongst them, as with the Kabulis;
but whether this is natural to them or the result of
the English occupation of the country on two occasions
many years ago, is problematical.</p>

<p>The people of Turkestan and the Usbegs are rather
Mongolian in feature, the type being in some more
pronounced than others. The Hazaras, whom Amir
Abdur Rahman brought into subjection, are decidedly
Mongolian in feature, and are mostly short, squat,
strongly built people.</p>

<p>Another race the late Amir subjugated, the Kafris,
are entirely distinct from the other races of the
country. They are generally very fair complexioned,
and have light-coloured eyes. They are not tall, and
are slimly yet symmetrically built. In many cases
their features are Grecian in type, and it is quite conceivable
that they are, as has been suggested, the
descendants of the garrisons Alexander the Great left
in the country on his historic march to India. They
were idolators until the Amir took them in hand and
converted them by fire and sword, and they have
little love for their new masters. They are quick and
intelligent, and make good workmen.</p>

<p>The language of the country is Pushtoo, which is
general among the people from Peshawar to Kandahar.
The Turkestanis use the Turki language, and the
Kafris have a language of their own, which latter
might form an interesting study for those who are
acquainted with the old Greek language. All people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
of any consequence speak Persian, which is the court
language, and the language used in Kabul itself, for
very few of the Kabulis are able to speak Pushtoo,
and with a knowledge of Persian one can get on anywhere
in the country, but it is less common among
the frontier tribes than elsewhere.</p>

<p>Persian is the language taught in the schools,
which the children attend from early morning until
about ten o’clock, and again in the late afternoon for
a couple of hours. In these schools the master,
usually a moullah, sits on a carpet in the centre of
the room with the children in a circle round him,
sitting cross-legged, with their books on their knees,
and reading aloud in a sing-song manner, while
rocking their bodies backwards and forwards. This
rocking the body to and fro while reading becomes
such a habit that in after life very few men can read
anything without doing it, and their voices take on
the sing-song intonation of the school. For the
chastisement of the unruly and stupid, the master has
a pliable rod by him. There is no sparing the rod
and spoiling the child, and when the master wishes
to punish one of them, the small offender is held on
his back, with his legs up in the air, and receives so
many cuts on the soles of his feet, and while the
punishment lasts he howls piteously. Sometimes in
passing by a school I have stopped, thinking a child
was surely being murdered, until I saw the reason
why the boy was howling, and my standing to watch
generally had the effect of stopping the child’s noise,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
for the “Feringhee” is one of the names used to
frighten children with. One end of the room in
which school is held has no wall, and is open on the
side facing the road, so there is nothing to prevent
one watching the school children at work.</p>

<p>Children are also taught in the school to read the
old Arabic, in order that they may read the Koran,
but while there are many men who can read Arabic,
there are few who understand it, and fewer still, if
any, who can speak it as a language. Many can
recite passages from the Koran as a parrot would do,
and some, who are thereby called Hafiz, can recite it
from memory from beginning to end.</p>

<p>In character the people are idle, luxurious, and
sensual, which characteristics become prominent as
soon as a man possesses power or money (almost
synonymous terms in Afghanistan). They are capricious
and ungrateful, and turn easily in their likes and
dislikes, and are readily led to turn against those to
whom they owe gratitude. Usually, when they want
anything, they want it at once, and should their
desire be delayed for any time, they no longer want
it. They are lying, treacherous, and vengeful, and
one who has a grudge or enmity against another will
not show it openly, but conceals his feelings and
feigns friendship, while waiting the opportunity for
vengeance, and in the execution of their vengeance
they are capable of unheard-of cruelties. They are
readily ruled by fear, but are apt to brood over small
grievances until they convince themselves that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
are most cruelly treated, and then their feelings may
result in a fit of Berserk rage, under the influence of
which they lose control of themselves and take
vengeance violently, often stabbing and hacking at
their victim long after life is extinct. They are cruel
and insensible to the pain of others, often laughing
at it, and, except in the case of a relative, will seldom
go out of their way to relieve suffering.</p>

<p>Towards their children they are too kind, and
spoil them while they are young, denying them
nothing which it is possible to give them, and dressing
them in gaudy clothes while they themselves go
ragged. They make no attempt to correct them for
any wrong-doing, laughing at it rather as a sign of
precociousness, and among the Kabulis it is a common
thing for a little child to be able to curse fluently,
and their curses are often directed at their parents.
This neglect in training the young properly accounts
for much that is objectionable in the character of the
people. It is not until children are seven or eight
years old that they begin to correct them, but a good
deal of the character of a child is at that age already
formed.</p>

<p>The Afghans are for ever scheming one against
another, family against family, official against official,
farmer against farmer, workman against workman,
and wife against wife—the latter being, naturally, one
of the evils which arise from the custom of plurality
of wives. The result of all this scheming is often a
quarrel which ends in a fight, in which one or other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
of the parties may be killed; they do not always use
knife or bullet for the purpose, they have other ways
too of ridding themselves of an enemy.</p>

<p>In the cities, when a man commits murder, he is
taken charge of and judged by the authorities, but in
the country it often results in a feud between the two
families, which is carried on for generations, the
murderer being waited for by the relatives of the
man whom he killed, and killed in turn; the slayer
in this case also being eventually slain by a member
of the opposite party, and so the feud goes on for
many years.</p>

<p>Illustrating the vengeful character of the people,
I may mention the case of a man who killed another
and escaped to his own house or fort, as it is called
by them, each house being in the nature of a stronghold.
Here he stayed for some thirty years, without
venturing to put his foot outside the house; but at
the end of that time, supposing the watchfulness of
his enemies had slackened, he went out one day,
and was carried back dead. The vengeance of the
relatives of the man he had killed had not slumbered,
neither had their watchfulness. It is said
that revenge is sweet, but it seems to have an added
sweetness to these people.</p>

<p>There is a law among the people that a man who
has been apprehended by the authorities for murder,
may be claimed by the murdered man’s relatives to
execute or forgive as they wish. The relatives may
then accept so much blood-money as compensation, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
may kill the man in any way they like. Sometimes
the haggling among the relatives about accepting
the blood-money offered by the murderer and his
friends, some being in favour of accepting the money,
and others in favour of death, is continued even under
the scaffold, where the condemned one stands ready
pinioned, and with the rope round his neck, and
after, perhaps, an hour or so of wrangling, it ends in
the decision that the man must suffer death, and then
the rope is seized and the man hauled up. The
feelings of the man during the altercation in such
cases must be unenviable.</p>

<p>Another case which further shows the vengeful
character of the people is that of a man who
murdered a boy, and was handed over to the relatives
for execution or forgiveness. The mother of the boy
resisted those in favour of blood-money, and insisted
on the man’s throat being cut, as he cut her son’s,
and when this was done, she, in the frenzy of her
vengeance, actually drank the blood as it flowed from
the man’s throat.</p>

<p>The amusements of the people are simple, and
would lead one to suppose them rather simple-minded,
if one did not know them. For instance, in the early
evening, when work is over, the people will flock in
summer-time to the public garden, where plots are
laid out with flowers, each plot having one kind of
flower only, carrying with them their singing-birds
in cages, and will sit round these plots until nightfall,
contentedly enjoying the scent of the flowers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
and the cool evening breeze. They sit there quietly,
and for the most part silently, and there is no noise
beyond the pit-pat of the slippers of those going and
coming on the garden paths. At one or two corners
of the garden walks are tea-sellers, with a little crowd
of people squatting round drinking tea out of the
small handleless cups commonly used, and taking a
pull at the chillum (pipe similar to a hookah) now
and then.</p>

<p>On Fridays (the Sundays of the Mussulmans),
and on holidays, many people go off walking or on
horse or donkey, when, in many cases, they ride two
together on one animal, and sometimes three, to the
gardens in the country, taking food and cooking-pots
with them; and there they will wander round the
gardens until midday, content to be amongst the
trees and flowers. Then they cook their food, and
after eating that, they lie about and chat, or doze
the afternoon away, and when evening begins to
gather, they get their belongings together, and start
off home again, having had a glorious day’s outing,
according to their own statement. They are easy to
please in this way, and anything which brings them
fresh air, sunlight, flowers, and grass or trees, and no
worry or duty, and, if possible, a little to eat and
drink while enjoying it all, is a day’s tamasha to be
talked over and retailed to others, and dreamt about
until the next opportunity comes.</p>

<p>When other means of amusement fail, they sit
together on the roof of the house, or in some quiet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
spot near by, where there may be a tree to shade them,
and one of them plays the rubarb, which is something
like a mandoline, and sings Persian love-songs. Out
of half a dozen men there is usually one who can
play and sing, and their songs sound best at a little
distance, for if close by the nasal intonation is not
prepossessing, while the contortions of the mouth
and face in bringing out the tremulous and prolonged
high notes rather fascinate one, and the song
is forgotten in watching them and waiting for the
breakdown, which seems momentarily imminent.
There are others of their stringed instruments which
resemble the banjo in shape, but all are called
“rubarb.” The music has little change about it,
and differs from ours in not being composed of
different airs, but in being of bars of four to six
beats, which are repeated over and over again. It
sounds very monotonous, and is a little trying, until
one gets used to it, and then, on a still summer
evening, the rubarb in the distance has rather a
soothing sound in its monotony, if one happens to
be reclining in an easy-chair, smoking and resting
after dinner. But if one is busy writing, or is
absorbed in calculations, or anything of that sort,
the monotony of the sound is very trying, and
produces a desire to make a change at any cost,
even if a shot-gun is necessary to effect it.</p>

<p>The people are like the rest of the Orientals, and
do not look upon exercise in any form as an amusement,
and therefore, are not in the habit of dancing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
as a means of recreation and pleasure, but they
have, instead, properly trained dancing-girls to do
so before them. The services of the dancing-girls
are requisitioned only on festivals and weddings,
or when some wealthy man gives an entertainment
to his friends on the occasion of a visit from one
of the princes or some high official person.</p>

<p>The dancing-girls are accompanied by men with
musical instruments who form the orchestra, and
among the instruments is the inevitable tom-tom or
drum, which is played by being struck with the
fingers or the hand, and not with drumsticks. The
life of the dancing-girl is a hard one, for the dancing
they practice is exhausting, and induces a good deal
of perspiration, and the girl is clad in light flimsy
muslin, while the nights even in summer are chill,
and all doors and windows are open to the breeze.
Consequently, she catches cold and gets fever and
continues to get it, for she must practice her profession
whenever called upon, so that it is not a
matter for surprise that these girls mostly die of
consumption. The dancing-girls in Kabul are Hindustanis,
from the Peshawar and Delhi districts, while
some are the offspring of former dancing-girls and
the men of the country. Although much has been
said about the Oriental dancing-girls’ poetry of
motion, and I have seen many others in different
parts of India, their action during the dance appears
very studied and wanting in grace, even with the
best of them, and none that I have seen are to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
compared with our own principal ballet-dancers for
grace of movement.</p>

<p>Among wild Afghan tribes, such as the Jidrani
and others, knife-dances are indulged in. About
fifty men arrange themselves in a circle with four or
five more in the centre, who beat tom-toms and tambourines,
and play on stringed instruments. The
dance commences by the men springing forward
towards the centre of the circle and back again,
flashing their knives about over their heads, and
singing in time to the music in a low tone, but
gradually the music, singing, and dancing become
louder and quicker, belts and turbans are thrown
off to allow of greater freedom of movement, and the
knives flash more rapidly, until at last the men seem
in a very frenzy, and the dancing becomes a series of
wild leaps in the air, knives are thrown up and
caught again, and the singing changes to a chorus of
wild yells. When the dance has reached its most
frenzied point, it suddenly ceases, and then there is a
loud clapping of hands by the dancers, and all is
over.</p>

<p>They have another wild dance which resembles
some strange rite of worshippers round a fetish. Two
or three men with tom-toms sit together, and the
dancers arrange themselves in a large circle round
them, but instead of facing towards the centre of the
circle as in the former dance, each man faces the one
in front of him. When the tom-toms begin, they
spring forward a step and stop momentarily, then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
spring forward again on the other foot, and so continue,
but during each spring they turn violently
half round to right or left as each foot advances, and
the sudden twist they give their bodies sends their
turbans or caps flying after the first few steps. In a
little while, when they begin to warm up to the
dance, they do a whole turn in the air during each
spring forward, and, as this is continued, the dancers
become more and more energetic, until their hair,
which is worn long and cut straight round the
shoulders, stands out like a mop being wrung out as
they spin round. Their arms, being also extended
at the same time, the whole effect, as they spin
round more rapidly and violently and the tom-toms
beat quicker, is exceedingly quaint.</p>

<p>Some of the people, mostly soldiers, go in for
swordstick combats. The swordsticks are similar to
the English ones, with basket guards, but the combatants
carry small round leather shields in addition,
which are held in the left hand, and not partly on
the forearm, as is usual with larger shields. Some
of the men are very expert in this exercise, but they
do very little guarding by means of the swordstick,
and catch most of the blows on the shield, for this
allows of a quicker return stroke. They are also much
in favour of leaping back to avoid a leg-cut, leaning
forward as they do so to get in a down-stroke at
their adversary’s head.</p>

<p>In the late spring of each year, the “Jubah”
takes place. The jubah is a fair combined with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
sports, and is held on a level strip of plain under the
Asman heights south-west of the city. Here they have
horse races, but the races are arranged on the spur of
the moment between one man and another, and are
not agreed on beforehand to determine the best of
several horses over a fixed course. Food and toy-stalls
are erected along the slopes of the hill, and all
Kabul and its children turn out for the three days
the fair is held. On these occasions the people put
on their best clothes, and the children are particularly
gaudy in their coloured velvet coats and caps. The
children’s toys are very quaint in appearance. The
dolls are made of stuffed rag, and are dressed in
Afghan fashion, and represent both men and women,
not children, while others represent demons. Then
there are small windmills fixed on the end of a stick,
and wooden whistles, and many other curiously shaped
articles, all gorgeously coloured, which children love.
There is also a Turkestani tight-rope walker dressed
in a gaily coloured fantastic costume, who fits up
two long poles with a rope between, both poles and
rope being very solidly made and very firmly fixed,
and gives displays thereon.</p>

<p>The jubah is also made the occasion for deciding
the wrestling contests between the chief “pulwans”
(athletes) of the city. These wrestling matches are
usually conducted before the Amir and the princes,
for whom tents are erected on the hillside, and the
Amir awards money prizes to the victors. The
keenest interest is taken in the wrestling by all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
people, and among the competitors defeat is in some
cases so taken to heart that the man will never wrestle
again, and others have been known to become so depressed
through being beaten as to commit suicide.</p>

<p>There is no course kept open for those who are
racing their horses, and the riders have to dodge in
and out amongst the people and other horses and
donkeys as best they can, and often man and horse
come to grief, chiefly over a donkey which gets out
of the way of no one, unless under compulsion. On
one occasion two men were racing their horses from
opposite ends of the plain, and met midway, and as
neither would give way to the other in passing they
collided, and the result was that one man and horse
were killed on the spot, and the other two died the
following day.</p>

<p>Story-tellers are in great favour among the people,
and a good <i>raconteur</i> may be sure of an attentive
audience. The bazar story-teller takes up his stand
in a busy thoroughfare, and begins telling his story.
In a short time he is surrounded by a large crowd,
eagerly drinking in the various episodes related,
while people riding or walking past have difficulty in
squeezing their way through the crowd, if they themselves
do not stop to swell it; but nothing is said or
done by the passers-by to disturb the story-teller in
his recital of the adventures of the prince or princess
among the various jinn, fairies, or “deoo” (demons)
of old time. Story-tellers are also attached to the
retinues of the Amir and the princes, and others of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
high standing. All their attendants and officials are
story-tellers in a way; but those mentioned are
special men, whose chief duty it is to tell stories to
their masters while the latter lie on their beds at
night and listen until they fall asleep.</p>

<p>In Kabul, when a guest is invited to dinner, the
invitation means that he is expected to stop the
night in the house of his host, and on these occasions,
when the dinner has been despatched, the guests
gather round the host, squatting or lying on carpets
while they smoke the chillum, and each one takes
his turn at telling a story. The interest in the
stories related is so great that they often sit listening
to one another far into the night, and are unfit for
work the following day.</p>

<p>Boys and children amuse themselves in much the
same way as English children. The chief game
among boys is “toop bazee,” which is played with
a flat piece of wood and a ball, and is very much
like rounders. They also go in for wrestling, and
fencing with sticks, and throwing arrows with a
piece of string, at which they are rather expert.
Some of the elder boys shoot sparrows and small
birds with clay pellets from a long blow-pipe, and
in order to get the birds at close range the boy
takes his stand beneath a tree and uses a call which
imitates a number of sparrows chirruping and fighting
together, and this induces the sparrows to come
and investigate the cause of trouble, when they offer
a good target from below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>Smaller children play with balls, knuckle bones,
marbles, and walnuts. The walnuts are used as in
a game of marbles, and any knocked out of the ring,
in which each player places a certain number, are
the property of the player who knocks them out.</p>

<p>Only very little girls are to be seen in the streets,
as at about eight years of age they become “purdah,”
<i>i.e.</i> no longer to be seen by men other than their
relatives, and are confined to the women’s quarters
of the house, and cannot go outside unless wearing
the “bukra,” or cotton overdress, which covers them
from head to foot, and has a slit covered with fine
lace in front of the eyes for them to see through.
Little girls may be seen sometimes on the house-top
playing at a game similar to ring-of-roses, or
playing with their dolls, and keeping house, or keeping
shop, and other games of make-believe, which
their sex delight in. Their greatest delight is to
have an English doll with English clothes, for their
own dolls are made of rag and dressed like themselves.</p>

<p>The people are very superstitious, and firmly believe
in ghosts, spirits, fairies, and devils, and most of
their stories are about these good and evil spirits,
as they term them, while their belief in them is
such that even men are chary of going about alone
at night. If a man is met at night walking alone
one generally first hears him and then sees him, for
he makes a good deal of noise as he walks, and also
whistles or sings as he goes along.</p>

<p>When I was stopping at the Mihman khana, I
came in late one night, having been for several
hours with the Amir, and while walking up to the
house from the gate, I noticed one of the syces
(grooms) coming from the house towards me, and
making a prodigious noise, whistling. He stopped
whistling when he saw me, and I wondered why he
was so noisy, such being unusual, but when I got to
my rooms I found the reason to be a nervous shock
he had had. It appeared that one of my Hindustani<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
servants, while in a facetious mood, had blacked
his face, or rather made it more black with burnt
cork, and whitened his lips and made white circles
round his eyes. Then, taking two sheepskin coats,
he had reversed them so that the hair was outside,
and putting his legs through the sleeves of one and
his arms through the sleeves of the other, had
fastened both round his waist, and then put on a
sheepskin cap with long hair. He dressed up afterwards
to show me, and his appearance was not prepossessing.
A guard of seven men was stationed
in the vestibule outside the door of my rooms, and
to these he came on hands and knees until quite
close, and then he started bounding towards them
with huge roars. Thinking that a real deoo (demon)
was on them, every man flung away rifle and sheepskin
coat, which is a heavy one, and fled wildly to
the guard-room at the outer gate; but one man, who
was asleep when the rest fled, woke up with the
noise and rose to a sitting position, staring round-eyed
at the apparition and booing, until he regained
enough consciousness to get up and fly. The demon
then went to the small room adjoining the verandah,
where the chaeedar’s quarters were (the man who
makes the tea). The chaeedar was sitting alone in
deep thought, on a small carpet with his back to
the window, which was open, but when this apparition
came through the door, he rose up and sprang
backwards through the window, regardless of possible
injury to himself or anything else, save that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
left the room immediately. The next people visited
were those of the Amir’s servants, who were appointed
to look after my comforts, and were always in my
sitting-room when on duty, and his appearance at
one door was the signal for their wild flight through
the other, chairs and tables being upset in the hurry
to get out. He then visited the other servants in
their quarters with great success, and it was soon
after it was over, and all had gathered together
again to relate their impressions and experience, that
I came in and the tale was told to me. All those
who had been frightened looked very sheepish, and
each man was trying to prove that he ran because
the other one did. However, the infection of fear
spread even to the apparition, and for several nights
after no one would go out, not even across the garden
to their own quarters, unless some one was with
them.</p>

<p>Fairies are generally supposed to inhabit the lonely
mountains around, and although they are believed to
be, on the whole, a good sort, the people are more
inclined to give them a wide berth than risk too
much by loitering about those places the fairies are
supposed to haunt. They are described as twelve to
eighteen inches high, very fantastically dressed, and
going about in a follow-my-leader manner, dancing
and skipping as they go. They are believed to be
afraid of men, and to hide themselves from them, and
so are only seen by those who are in hiding or sleeping
in out-of-the-way places. Of children they are said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
to have no fear, but it is unwise to let a child stray
near their haunts, as it may be put under a spell, or
perhaps changed for one of their own children, who is
made to take the face and form of the stolen child,
and then the changeling will bring all sorts of bad
luck upon its foster-parents.</p>

</figure>

<p>The supernatural being the people dread most, and
to whom they put down much that happens which
cannot be satisfactorily explained, is the shaitan.
Shaitans are demons who take many forms according
to the fear or gift of exaggeration of the individual
who thinks he has seen one. These beings they
imagine may be behind any bush or boulder after
sundown, and they also believe them capable of coming
into the sleeping-room at night to frighten them into
fits by their very ugliness, if nothing worse befalls,
so the people sleep with head as well as body covered
with blanket or rezai. They never sleep alone in
a room, but several together, and many have been
astonished when I told them that in my country
each person has a separate room, if possible, and that
children are put to sleep alone at night. They say it
is not that they really fear a shaitan, for God is
good, but they are not accustomed to sleeping alone,
and, besides, it is unwise to be alone at night should
a spirit happen to come in.</p>

<p>One of my servants solemnly assured me one
morning that the night before his charpoy (bedstead)
was lifted from the floor and swung round the room
with him on it until he felt giddy, and at the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
time he heard the most strange noises. He, however,
admitted, on being questioned, that he kept his eyes
firmly shut and saw nothing, and no doubt his head
was wrapped close in the bedclothes. However, he
wanted another room to sleep in, and refused to
occupy that room again, and whether the other
servants played him a trick or whether it was a
bad attack of indigestion that troubled him I could
not discover, but the room he slept in was afterwards
used as a store-room by the other servants, and the
name it acquired was sufficient to deter the servants
who came after him from sleeping in it.</p>

<p>Another time the ceiling-cloth of one of my office-rooms
came down during the night. It is a common
occurrence, because the earth that falls through
between the rafters from the mud roofs brings a
gradually increasing weight to bear on the ceiling-cloth,
and it sags until the cloth, sooner or later, rips
at the edges and comes down. When I went to see
the damage done the men with me said that it was
assuredly the work of a shaitan, for who else could
do it with the windows bolted and the door locked?
To argue against logic like this was useless.</p>

<p>Another story told me by an Afghan about
shaitans was that one evening after visiting some
friends, he had some distance to walk before getting
home, and the road lay through a burial-ground
(burial-grounds have no walls round them as in
England). It was late when he got among the
graves, and the thought of walking alone there made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
his flesh creep, but he kept on until he was nearly
through, and then he saw little flames rise from the
ground in front of him and flicker about. This terrified
him, and he put on an extra spurt to get clear
of the graves, when the figure of a man appeared
in front. The sight of another man calmed him until,
on coming closer to the figure, he saw that a shawl
was wrapped round the head (shawls are commonly
worn so at night when the air is chill), and the eyes in
the face shone like two stars, while the nearer he got
to the figure the taller it grew, until it loomed high
above him, and then he turned and ran back. But
the house he had left was much further away from
where he then was than his own home, so after
running for a time he determined to face the graveyard
again. But the same thing happened, only now,
being in a frenzy to get out of it all, he made a dash
to get past the figure, and, while doing so, he lost
consciousness, and did not recover it until the early
morning, when he found himself lying on the road,
but just clear of the graves, and to that he attributed
his salvation.</p>

<p>Another Afghan told me that he was sleeping one
night in the serai at Gundamak, when he awoke
without knowing the reason of his waking, and sat
up. Then one wall of the room he was in disappeared,
and there on the ground beyond he saw a
regiment of Gorawallahs (English soldiers) march
past, but without making any noise, and their faces
were white in the moonlight, and wore an awful look.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
This man, too, lost consciousness until the morning,
or rather, he said he did.</p>

<p>The people have a curious legend about sponges.
They say the English people take very large earthen
jars, and set them on the highest peaks of the mountains,
and conceal the pots by piling stones round
them, so that only the mouth shows. They then
hide themselves in the crevices of the rocks, and wait
until the clouds settle on the mountain-top, and come
slowly down to the jars. Then, when a small cloud
is seen to enter the jar, one of the men comes
cautiously from his hiding-place, and quickly puts
the lid on, and fastens it there. The jar is allowed
to remain closed for about three days, by which time
the cloud is dead, after which the vessel is broken
and the dead cloud is cut into pieces, and taken out
and sold as sponge. The Persian name for “sponge”
is the same as for “cloud,” and perhaps this accounts
for the legend.</p>

<p>Astrologers do a good business among the people,
and their forecasts as to the lucky days on which to
commence a journey or some new work are implicitly
believed. The Amir and the members of the royal
family have their own astrologers, who are consulted
as to the auspicious day on which to commence any
matter of importance, besides being asked to read
what the future contains, but their verdicts, or such
of them that I have heard, are ambiguous, and
capable of being read in more than one way—a very
necessary art for those who read the riddle of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
future for the Amir. The astrologers have also
to interpret dreams, for dreams are looked upon as
signs given to warn or guide people, and it was due
to a dream that the present Amir divorced all his
wives but the four allowed by the Koran. It is not
all people who consider themselves capable of predicting
the future who are treated with honour and
amass wealth, as witness the case of three men from
a distant part of the country, who were brought
before the Amir for predicting that a great calamity
was to visit the country on a certain date, some few
months ahead, and who expected much from their
voicing of the prophecy. The Amir’s mood, which
is always an uncertain quality, at the time the men
were brought before him, was not inclined towards
signs of evil portent, and he gave an order that the
prophets be kept in prison until the date fixed by
them for the happening of the calamity, and then, he
said, they shall be rewarded if their words are
shown to be true, but in the other event, death.
The prophecy was not fulfilled, but the Amir’s
sentence was.</p>

<p>The astrologers cast horoscopes, and tell fortunes
with cards, and use other implements of the black art,
for forecasting future events, and very rapidly make
name and fortune, when once one of their prognostications
is fulfilled, for then all their utterances are
treated as truth itself, and should at any time any of
their further prognostications prove contrary to
actual happenings, the people do not blame the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
fortune-teller, but themselves instead, for the predictions
being always more or less ambiguous, the people
consider it their own misconstruction of his words
which prevented them knowing what was about to
happen. This sort of sophistry does not pertain to
the credulous among Afghans alone.</p>

<p>The superstitious and religious beliefs mingle,
as they do in other countries, and should any one
praise a child for any attribute of mind or body at
once, “nam i Khuda” (God’s name) must be said to
avert the evil which open praise will beget. The
evil eye is also supposed to be possessed by some
persons, and God’s name must be spoken to avert
its calamitous effect. Curiously enough, those credited
with the evil eye are not blamed for its possession,
but are said to be unlucky. In like manner, those
who are skilful in curing and healing the sick and
maimed, are said to have a lucky hand.</p>

<p>They have one custom which will commend itself
to many, and that is, to collect the children on the
roofs of the different houses, and there sing prayers
in unison, for the averting of cholera, earthquakes,
or other calamity, because the children, being more
innocent than their elders, their prayers are supposed
to be more readily listened to. The roofs of the houses
are all close together, and it is pleasant to see the
groups of children standing in lines on the different
roofs, and listen to them singing the prayers with
their clear young voices, and when the calamity to
be averted is cholera, one rather hopes their prayers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
may be listened to, for cholera makes a several
months’ stay when it visits Kabul, and is a trying
time for all concerned.</p>

<p>The food of the majority of the people in Kabul
is of a simple description, consisting, as it does, of
dry bread, which is made into cakes, oval in shape,
and about twelve inches long, by half an inch thick.
Those who can afford it, take curds and cheese with
the bread, and sometimes meat and vegetables made
into a stew. The Chinese green tea is almost always
taken with food and it is a very poor man who will
not expend three pice (a halfpenny) on a pot of tea,
even if cheese must be omitted from the bill of fare
to afford it. In the summer-time fruit is plentiful
and cheap; vegetables too, and lettuce is grown in
large quantities. Two pice (little more than a
farthing) will procure enough fruit to make a good
meal for a man, and in the season most of the people
met with on the streets are to be seen eating fruit,
lettuce, or rhubarb, which latter grows wild in the
mountains.</p>

<p>Very poor people live mostly on mulberries,
which they also dry for winter consumption. Many
of the Hazaras, who are a saving people, live on
nothing else during the summer months, and cases
of broken limbs through falling from the trees while
gathering mulberries, are common. A diet of mulberries
induces fever, particularly in those persons
not accustomed to them, and the fever is of a serious
nature, and many die of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>The Koochee people, a sort of gipsy race who
have no fixed home, but constantly travel about the
country with their cattle and camels, and do a trade
carrying goods and merchandise from place to place,
and who are a most hardy race, live on corn bread,
sheep and goat milk, cheese, and grass, eating the
latter uncooked. Spinach, which grows wild, is also
largely eaten by them, as well as by the other people
of the country.</p>

<p>The food of the Afghans of the villages is
principally soup and bread with curds, sour milk,
butter-milk, and fruit. Butter-milk is a particular
favourite with them, and an Afghan can drink a very
fair quantity of it at a sitting.</p>

<p>If a camel, cow, or other esculent animal is sick,
and it is certain that it is dying, the throat is cut,
and the customary prayer said to make it halal (lawful
eating), and the meat is then sold or eaten by the
owners. I once saw a dying camel, that looked all
skin and bone, being goaded along the bank of the
river to the city that he might be killed close to the
market for the better disposal of the meat, and it
seemed as though the poor animal might topple over
and die at any moment and cheat his master. There
is little compassion in the bowels of an Afghan.</p>

  <p class="right">[<i>To face p. 88.</i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The better classes and well-to-do people eat of
many savoury dishes, of which the principal are pilau
and kabob; the latter being meat well peppered and
salted, and roasted on a skewer over a fire (a roast leg
of mutton is also a kabob). The pilau are of different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
sorts, and are composed of rice, spices, and meat; the
rice and meat being stewed separately and mixed
together on a dish. Preserves, pickles, sweetmeats,
fruit, bread, are also eaten, and the ever present tea
is taken to wind the meal up with, and with the tea
the chillum is handed round, that tobacco may put
the crowning touch on all. Large quantities of tea
are consumed daily by the Kabulis, who drink it as
often as they can afford it.</p>

<p>Women smoke the chillum as well as men. It
is shaped like the hookah, but has a straight stem
instead of a flexible one. The tobacco is of country
growth, and is very rank smelling, more resembling a
burning oil rag than anything else.</p>

<p>The Afghans call any large, fat man a strong one,
and as fatness is considered a sign of both health and
prosperity, all people who can afford to do so, eat
until gorged, and in consequence many of them, both
men and women, are grossly fat. The late Amir’s
chief physician was so fat he could not walk, and
had to be carried. Another man was so fat that he
could do nothing for himself, and had to be washed
and dressed by his slave girls, much as a baby is. Of
this man I was told that he once noticed a very
objectionable smell about his body, and in spite of
all that was done to better it, the smell at last got so
bad that he told the slave girls to carry him to the
hamam and bath him, and while washing him, as
ordered, the girls discovered the cause of the nuisance
to be a dead frog hidden in one of the folds of fat.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
It had no doubt got in when the man was having
his last tub, and been crushed to death.</p>

<p>Snuff-taking is also commonly indulged in by
the better-class people. The poorer people, however,
use the native tobacco, roughly crushed, and put it
in their mouths, and there are some who can afford
the snuff brought up from India who do the same
in preference to sniffing it up the nose.</p>

<p>It is only in the large houses that there are fire-places,
but there are few people who are wealthy
enough to afford the cost of the large quantity of
wood required during the winter months in order
to keep the rooms warm enough to sit in, for the
doors and windows of all houses are so badly fitted
that the draughts of wind make the rooms unbearably
cold even with a large fire going, and one has
to sit in furs to be comfortable. So, to reduce the
cost of fuel to a minimum and yet keep themselves
warm day and night, the people have the “sandalee.”
This is formed of a square wooden stool placed in
the centre of the room and under the stool a small
perforated iron box standing on legs, in which charcoal
is burnt, and over all is spread a large rezai or
quilt which covers the stool and fire-box, and
extends on all sides over most of the floor of the
room. The stool is used in order to keep the rezai
away from the fire-box. Charcoal is lighted in
the iron box, and when it is burning brightly the
box is placed under the centre stool, whence the heat
from the fire spreads under the whole of the rezai<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
and keeps it very warm, and under such a cover
the charcoal burns very slowly and the fire lasts
for hours. Thin mattresses and pillows placed under
the outer portion of the rezai are used to sleep on,
or sit on in the daytime. Under this the whole of
the family, father, mother, sons and their wives,
daughters, children, aunts, and other relations, sleep
at night, all being kept warm on the coldest night
at the cost of a few pice for charcoal. The drawback
is that at times with a newly lighted fire, the
charcoal fumes are excessive, and produce nausea
and headache, and sometimes suffocation, and also
when a person is in the habit of using it during
the day while having occasionally to go out into
the frosty air, he often gets rheumatism, or other
complaint. Another drawback is the moral effect
on a whole family of men and women sleeping
together in a small space under the rezai, and many
call the sandalee “the devil’s playground.” In the
guardrooms the soldiers use these sandalees too, the
men sitting with their legs tucked under the rezai,
while they have sheepskin coats covering the head
and body, and in this way they can defy the bitterest
wind. It is the one standing outside on guard who
gets frozen to death at times.</p>

<p>In Kabul and the principal cities time is kept
by means of a sundial, but though there are tables
printed in Persian of the daily difference between
solar and mean time, the time given by them is only
approximate, for the dials have been constructed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
for other latitudes, and they are fixed in the direction
of the magnetic north instead of the true one. One
day, after ascertaining the true time, I informed the
Amir that the midday gun was twenty minutes fast;
but he said it was better so, for then they would
not be late for midday prayers. Daily at midday
a gun is fired to announce the time to the people,
and those who have clocks and watches set them
accordingly. Comparatively few, however, of the
people are able to tell the time from a clock,
and many have the most hazy idea of the length
of time expressed by an hour or half an hour.
This ignorance extends also to numbers, the people
generally being able to count up to twenty, and
any number above that is expressed as so many
“taman” (score) together with the odd figure to
make up the number. Some of the people do not
even know the days of the week, and have to be
told that a certain day is so many days after the
present one.</p>

<p>Courtship and marriage in Afghanistan differ in
many respects from those interesting episodes in
European countries, but in no respect more than
in the man not seeing the girl until they are married,
and she is his wife. Men in Afghanistan are not
prone to talk about their wives, or the women of
their family, and to ask after a man’s wife is akin
to an insult, as evincing some degree of familiarity
with her. Under these circumstances a man’s feelings
while he is waiting to see what sort of girl he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
has married are not ascertainable by direct question,
but one would suppose that there must be an anxiety
bordering on the intense to know what manner of
woman it is that must hereafter be called “wife,” for
the women vary in face and form as much as the
men, and the “pig in the poke” may be as beautiful
as a houri, or as ugly as sin, if not uglier in the
opinion of some sinners.</p>

<p>Excepting in the case of boy and girl betrothals
among people of high rank, which are arranged by
the heads of the families, or when a young man’s
relations arrange which woman he shall marry, it is
usual for a man when he desires another wife to
make known his wishes to his friends and his intention
soon becomes public property. He then receives
overtures from men with marriageable daughters, and
the discussions with one and another are no light
matter, for the prospective father-in-law expects
money or kind in exchange for his daughter, and the
beauty and qualities of the said daughter being an
unknown quantity, the man is not inclined to be
either liberal or rash. However, when the proceedings
have at length assumed so much headway that
the man is satisfied with the standing of the family
the girl belongs to, and the family’s future prospects,
and considers that the father of the girl has reduced
his demands to the lowest fraction, he then sends his
female relatives to inspect the cause of the trouble,
and on their verdict, other things being satisfactory,
concludes the bargain. When all the bargaining is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
over the ceremony of betrothal takes place, followed
sooner or later by the marriage ceremony.</p>

<p>The marriage ceremony depends for splendour
and feasting upon the wealth and standing of the
families of the contracting parties. With members of
the royal family and people of high rank, it means a
three days’ tamasha, with the feasting of a great
number of relatives and friends, and expenditure of
further money in dancing-girls, bands, and other
things. Although the expenditure varies according
to the wealth of the persons concerned, in all cases
the greatest splendour consistent with the rank of
the contracting parties is aimed at, even if money
must be borrowed to give a good show off, and in this
they do not differ much from people nearer London.
When the marriage ceremony is completed, the bride
is carried in a sort of sedan chair to the bridegroom’s
house, and the bridegroom, together with many of his
relations and friends riding on horseback, accompany
her, carrying guns, which they fire as they go along,
while in front of them goes a drum and fife band
with men dancing and pirouetting in front of it.
The shooting of guns is a relic of older times when a
man with the aid of his friends had to obtain his
bride by force of arms or some stratagem, and then
carry her away in front of his saddle while her relatives
pursued them.</p>

<p>The weddings of the poor people have no display
such as this, and the bride and bridegroom have perforce
to walk before and after the ceremony, for they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
cannot afford a moullah, or priest, to come to the
house, and so have to go to his place to be married.
They may be seen in the street, the bridegroom
walking first and the bride after him (no woman
must walk in front of or even abreast a man); and
after her is a girl friend or relative, carrying her
clothes in a bundle on her head. In front of them
walks a man with a tom-tom (native drum), and
another with a tin whistle, both doing their best to
enliven the proceedings by making the most noise
possible with the instruments at their disposal, and so
they wend their way to the bridegroom’s poor house.</p>

<p>I was told in Kabul that there is an old Afghan
marriage custom among some of the tribes which
differs from the above. With them, a man who
wishes to marry a girl is allowed to live for some
time in her father’s house, using the girl as his wife,
and when after a reasonable time has elapsed, there
is evidence that the girl is going to become a mother,
he marries her. Should this not happen, the man
is at liberty to marry her, or depart, and elsewhere
seek a wife who is capable of continuing his family.
The wish for a son is very strong among the
Afghans, and whereas the birth of a boy is accompanied
with great rejoicing, the birth of a girl passes
unnoticed, the father showing his displeasure to the
extent of, at times, refusing to see the mother until
his anger has cooled with the passing of time.</p>

<p>The treatment of the body of a dead person
before burial is much the same as among Europeans,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
except that the body is buried the day death occurs,
and should a person die at night, the body is buried
the next morning. When a man dies, the moullahs
(priests) are sent for, and they wash the body (this
is usually done at the side of the nearest stream),
lay it out, and wrap it in the burial-sheet ready
for interment. The burial-sheet is called “kafn,”
which is a word similar to our “coffin.” No coffin
is used. After preparing the body for burial, the
moullahs say the prayers for the dead over it, in
which they are joined by all the relatives and others
present, the relations are sent for as soon as it is
seen that a person is dying, and then the body is
placed on a charpoy (wooden bedstead) and carried
to the nearest musjid on the road to the graveyard,
where the prayers for the dead are again said, after
which the body is carried on to the burial-ground.
Here the grave has been prepared beforehand, dug
down some three feet, but recessed on one side at
the bottom to receive the corpse, and as the earth
must not fall on the body when filling the grave
up, slabs of stone are placed against the recess. The
body is laid on its side in the recess, with the face
looking in the direction of Mecca, so that it may
more easily see the beginning of the resurrection
on the last day, and the grave is then filled up.
According to Mussulmans, the resurrection on the
last day begins at Mecca. A slab of stone about
three feet by one foot, is placed at the head of the
grave, but the stone is rough and uncut, and any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
stone which is lying about is used, provided the
shape is suitable. In the case of very important
personages, a properly cut stone, setting forth the
name of the person buried there, is placed at the
head of the grave, and this used to be commonly
done to mark the resting-places of other people, but
the stones were taken by the late Amir for buildings,
as they were of a good quality, and nice white
colour, and so the practice fell into disuse.</p>

<p>After the burial, the relatives and friends gather
in the house of the deceased person, and here they
are entertained by the family, tea and food being
provided for all who call to offer condolences, and
to say the “fateah” or prayers for the dead, which
it is customary to say on coming into the house.
The expenses for these entertainments, and also
those connected with marriages were so great, and
brought so many into poverty, on account of all
trying to do as well as, or better than their
neighbours, whether they could afford it or not,
that the present Amir made it a law that all such
entertainments should cease, and instead of being
in a way public affairs, should be made private,
and guests include relatives only.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that a person dies so poor that
there is not enough money even to buy the “kafn”
(burial-sheet), which is only a shilling or so, and his
relatives have to go through the bazars begging for one,
or money to buy one. This happens now more often
than it used to, for the people are yearly getting poorer.</p>

<p>Absolute monarchy is the system of government in
Afghanistan. Fortunately there are few parts of the
earth where such a form of government exists, for it
is not one which is likely to produce the greatest
good for the greatest number.</p>

<p>In Afghanistan no one but the Amir can order
the death penalty; no important question concerning
the internal government of the country or its political
relations with other countries can be dealt with or
settled except by him; all matters of import emanating
from the various State departments and offices
must be referred to him for final judgment; all
officers and officials required for the Government
service in different parts of the country must be
selected and appointed by him, and all prisoners
accused of any crime of a serious nature must be
tried and sentenced by him. Besides these duties
there are innumerable other matters which require<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
his attention, of which the mere reading of the private
reports from spies occupies several hours each
day. From this it will be seen that the man who
can carry out all these duties and give each question
the consideration due to it without neglecting some
matter or another of importance to the interests of
the country, is one who requires a quickness in
grasping the essential points of a question, and a
capacity for work which are unequalled.</p>

<p>Amir Abdur Rahman was an exceptionally able
man, and one who willingly gave the whole of
his time and attention to the work required of him,
working from the time he rose from his bed until he
lay down again; but even so he was unable to see to
all things himself, and the absence of responsible
officials duly authorized to investigate and settle
those matters which were not of sufficient moment
to be taken before him for judgment, wasted much
of the time which ought to have been devoted to
important questions on which the welfare of the
country depended. However, it is not surprising
that the Amir was chary of putting too much authority
in the hands of his officials, for those who had
authority to judge minor cases invariably abused the
authority given them, and the people who suffered
through such abuse of authority, feared the enmity
of the official too much to appeal to the Amir, and
generally they were given cause to do so. As a case
in point, I may mention that of a camel-owner who
was brought before the city magistrate concerning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
the non-payment of some Government duty. In this
case the man was forced to pay the duty, besides
having two of his camels confiscated, for the magistrate
did a transport business with camels himself.
The camel-owner was naturally incensed at the injustice
of the whole proceeding, and wrote the particulars
to the Amir, bribing an official to give in his
application. Bribery must be resorted to in those
cases where an official is the intermediary. All this
was timely reported to the magistrate, who at once
betook himself to durbar, and laid the case in his
own way before the Amir, making out that the man
was an old offender, and, to prevent him running
away before his highness had judged his punishment,
he had kept two of his camels as security. The
letter the man had written was brought in just then
and handed to the Amir; but the Amir’s mind was
prejudiced, and he saw in the man’s statement—and
an Afghan always overstates the case—an endeavour
to injure the character of the magistrate in revenge
for the latter doing his duty. The man was therefore
put in prison, and the whole of his property was
confiscated, so that he lost all he had instead of getting
back the two camels first taken.</p>

<p>With the Amir it is always the man who gets in
his story or complaint first who wins, for the Afghan
mind is readily prejudiced and chary of relinquishing
first impressions, no matter how much truth lies in
what is said by the man who speaks last. It is such
cases as these, and more often than not an appeal to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
the higher power results in disaster to the applicant,
which make the people chary of disputing the actions
of the officials, and they therefore have to put up
with as much justice as they can get, either by
intrigue or bribery, and keep quiet, while the officials
grow fat and rich, and become arrogant with continued
prosperity, until one day they fly at game too
high for them, and then come to grief and lose all,
ending their days in prison or at the hands of the
executioner. The late Amir one day told me that he
trusted no one, and was so suspicious that he did not
let his right hand know what the left one did; and
with such men round him it is not surprising that he
should have felt so.</p>

<p>Another thing which is further detrimental to
the country lies in the officials being consulted on all
matters concerning the interests of the people, for
the Amir has no means of ascertaining the views and
wishes of the people himself, and has to accept what
his officials say, and this gives them the opportunity
of bringing about that which is to their interest, and
it is due to this selfish disregard of anything but their
own profit that the officials force the people in yearly
increasing numbers to give up the cultivation of
their land and seek work elsewhere.</p>

<p>The Amir and the Government of Afghanistan
are said by the people to be separate and distinct,
and there is a public and a private treasury, on both
of which the Amir draws, himself defining those expenses
which are private, and those the Government<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
must defray; but here all distinction ends, and
it is difficult to see wherein the difference lies. I
have been told that the Amir is the head of the
Government; but so far as I could see he was head,
body, and everything else, excepting where officials
and governors of provinces save him the trouble of
looking into matters which are profitable to themselves.
The Government stores chiefly contain the
arms and ammunition made in the country or purchased
elsewhere, while the private stores, in addition
to those goods which are required for daily use, contain
the valuable presents brought in from all parts
of the country by the chiefs who visit the Amir, and
those received from other Governments, and contain
immense treasures. In the private stores also are
all the latest novelties which have been sent for from
India, and there are few articles in that way which
are not to be found there. Very few, however, of
the articles, except those of daily use, go into the
stores and come out of it again, for most of the things
are put away and forgotten, and neither the Amir
nor his storekeepers know all that the stores contain,
for there are no proper records kept except of articles
of intrinsic value.</p>

<p>The late Amir was very particular about his
palaces, and the dwelling-places he built for himself
were the first well-constructed buildings in the country,
and they were furnished in the richest European style,
all furniture and upholstery being of the best he could
get in India or make in his own country. He insisted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
on all things about him being kept clean and tidy,
and woe betide the unlucky slave boy who neglected
his duty in that respect.</p>

<p>His food was cooked in the Government kitchens,
which are kept guarded so that no one but those who
are authorized to do so can enter, and the chief cook,
with several soldiers, had to accompany the dishes
from the kitchen to the palace (all dishes are served
at once, and not in courses), and when placed before
the Amir it was the cook’s duty to taste of each dish
to show that the food was innocent of poison. Several
high officials always dined with the Amir, the latter
being seated at a small table covered with a white
cloth, while on the ground stretching away in front
of his table a long cloth was laid which was covered
by another white one, and here, on both sides,
squatted or kneeled the officials, all of them, the
Amir included, eating with the right hand. The
hands are washed both before and after a meal.
The very best and richest foods, in the way of pilaus
and kabobs, were cooked, and all were seasoned with
spices, and the bread was the usual Afghan nan (flat
cake), but the Amir preferred white bread baked in
small loaves similar to the English ones.</p>

<p>If an Englishman dined with the Amir he was
given a separate table, and a Hindustani cook and his
assistants prepared and served the food in the usual
English way, while, for drink, he had the choice of
various wines and spirits, which the Amir used to
keep in the stores for such purpose, although he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
himself always drank water, in accordance with the
tenets of his religion.</p>

<p>The Amir’s drinking water, as well as all food for
him, was very carefully guarded. One man was held
responsible for it, and had charge of the key of
the room in which it was kept locked. The same
was done with the tea, for which another man was
responsible, and another, a hakeem (doctor), was
responsible for all medicine, mixing it and bringing
it to the Amir himself. The positions these men held
were no sinecure, for if the Amir had any strange
pain in his body they had a very unpleasant time of
it until the pain was gone, or proved to be due to
natural causes, and at such times these men went
about with a strained look on their faces, for none
knew what fancy might seize the Amir to their
undoing.</p>

<p>The present Amir follows the same procedure as
his father, but, owing to one or two plots against
him, which fortunately came to nothing, all measures
for safety are more strictly enforced, and all the men
responsible for what the Amir eats and drinks wear
a more harassed look.</p>

<p>One of the late Amir’s precautions was to be
always ready at a moment’s notice either for fighting
or travelling to any part of his kingdom, or out of it
if needs be. For this purpose several horses (which
were changed every few hours) were kept day and
night in the stalls by the door of the palace ready
saddled and bridled, requiring only the girths to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
tightened for mounting. Several fast mules were
also kept ready in other stalls for carrying treasure,
etc., on the journey. A cupboard with glass doors was
kept by the head of the Amir’s bed in which was
stacked his best rifles, and with them boxes of
ammunition, while under his pillow were two or
three revolvers ready loaded, so that the Amir was
ever ready for emergencies. In addition a picked
company of sowars, called the “Hazarbash” guard
(ever present), were always ready night and day outside
the palace to accompany the Amir. This guard
the Amir kept provisioned for a few days, so that
they might start at any moment on a journey, and
those on duty were relieved at intervals. The Amir’s
life had been an adventurous one, and it had taught
him, and his experience in ruling his people had confirmed
it, that it is wise to be ready at all times for
anything that happens.</p>

  <p>(<i>From a drawing by the Author.</i>)</p>
  <p class="right">[<i>To face p. 104.</i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It was the Amir’s custom to sit up working most
of the night, and not to retire to rest until about four
o’clock in the morning. He would then rise between
twelve and two o’clock in the day, and, after dressing
and taking food, would hold durbar. This habit of
keeping awake most of the night was probably due
to fear of a rising or treachery, which would be
attempted at night rather than during the day, when
all the people were about. Occasionally he held
a public durbar in the salaam khana, a specially
large audience chamber built in the garden outside
Arak, and on these occasions any persons desirous of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
petitioning him were allowed to come before him, and
anything they had to say was listened to. The people
who wanted to make personal application to the Amir
were ushered in by the shagrasi, an official whose duty
it was to present people to the Amir; but they had
first to square the captain of the guard on the gate,
and also certain other persons through whose hands
they passed, before being allowed in. The Amir was
a very hard worker, and opened and answered all
letters as they came, and continued doing so, no
matter what other business was in hand, until he
slept. As soon as he was dressed each day people
were brought before him either to state their grievances
or for trial, and deputations from tribes in various
parts of the country were received and listened to.
He put off no work until a later date that was
possible of completion, but tried to get each day’s
work finished <i>the same</i> day.</p>

<p>The Amir seldom spent much time in the
harem serai amongst his women, it being his custom
to devote an occasional evening to them only, and
his opinion of women in general was not a high one.
On some occasions he spoke rather plainly of the
length, and lying propensities, of a woman’s tongue,
and her general inaptitude for anything of worth,
and love of intrigue. Solomon eventually found little
worth having in woman’s society, and no doubt
familiarity breeds contempt in more cases than his.</p>

<p>The Amir’s amusements were few and simple.
He would stop for a few weeks in turn, at each of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
summer palaces in the spring and early summer, to
enjoy the air of the country and the scent of the
flowers, of which he was passionately fond, and would
eventually reach Baghibala, which is some four miles
out of the city on the road to Paghman, and was his
favourite summer palace, and would stop there until
winter drove him back to the warmer city palaces.
The Amir always had flowers in the room where he
was, and in winter and spring when there were no
flowers in Kabul, he had them sent from Jelalabad
and other places which are at a lower altitude than
Kabul and have a warmer climate. One day when I
was with the Amir, he spoke of some flowers beside
him, and taking one of them smelt it, and found it
had no scent. The gardener was ordered to be sent
for, and he came in with pale face and knees knocking
against each other, for having no knowledge of the
reason why he was wanted, he no doubt feared the
most, and probably he was the same as others in
having done more than he would care for the Amir
to know. When the Amir looked up from his reading
and saw the gardener, he asked why the flowers had
no smell, and the gardener, at a loss to reply, could
only lick his dry lips as he sought an excuse. The
Amir, however, told him of a certain manure he was
always to use, and bade him beware if the flowers
had no scent the following year, and then told him
to return to his work.</p>

<p>Occasionally the Amir would drive or be carried
out to the chaman (marshy plain) where duck<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
shooting was obtainable, but during the last few years
of his reign he was seldom equal to the exertion of
doing so, for he suffered almost constantly from gout
and its accompanying ailments. His indoor amusements
were chess, of which he was so able an exponent
that few in his court could compete with him,
and his only other amusement was in listening to or
telling stories, and joking with one and another of
the officials, during the occasional free-and-easy hour
following dinner, when the Amir became as one of
those surrounding him, and gave himself up to jest
and repartee, before again assuming the duties and
dignity of the head of the State. One of the
recognized members of his suite was the court jester,
who was dressed, however, as others were, and not in
cap and bells, whose duty it was to joke and make
merry when the Amir was so inclined. The jokes
and stories, and the gestures used to illustrate
the stories were, however, always too broad for those
who are delicately inclined. This may be the outcome
of the want of women’s refining influence, for
women, of course, are never present in such gatherings,
and men mingle with men, and see no women
except those of their own house. Jesters were also
among the retinues of the princes; but, without the
restraining influence of the Amir to keep them a little
in check, the jokes of these men were not even fit for
a barrack-room.</p>

<p>The attendants with the Amir, or ghulam bachaha
(slave boys), as they are called, are mostly the sons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
of chiefs. These boys are given to the Amir for his
use, and are trained in his service, and when they
grow up, are given civil or military appointments.
These attendants, besides waiting on the Amir, had
charge of various duties, some being placed in charge
of the lamps and candles, others the carpets, others
books and papers, others arms, etc.; and each was
held responsible for the proper conduct and safe
keeping of that in his charge. Neglect of duty or
other offence was punished at once, and often
severely. In one case, some boys were stripped of
their clothes and tied to trees in the garden, and
kept there the greater part of a winter night.
Another, a storekeeper, had his nose cut off for
stealing some of the articles in his charge. All had
to be cleanly dressed, and while in the Amir’s
presence, had to keep silence, and walk or move
about without noise. Their clothes were gaudy,
being mostly of coloured velvets, with plenty of gold
lace and fur trimmings, and their turbans or hats
were of the richest description. The present Amir,
who is fond of plain dress and quiet colours, has his
attendants dressed in black clothes cut in the fashion
of frock-suits, the frock-coats being rather long and
more in the Turkish official style, while among the
officials generally a similar style of dress is worn,
except when a man has a position which entitles him
to a uniform, which pleases him best the more gold
lace it has. There were many officials, as well as
slave boys, who dressed in velvets in the court of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
Amir Abdur Rahman, and on a durbar day they
presented a gay appearance, so far as dress was
concerned.</p>

<p>After ’97 the Amir’s feelings towards England
and the English changed, and those of his court had
to see that they conducted themselves as comported
with his mood. Sirdar Mahomed Omar told his half-brother,
Sirdar Aminoolah, one day at that time, not
to go before his father in the English gaiters he was
wearing, and to be careful not to wear anything
English on such occasions. The Amir was greatly
disappointed in the failure of Sirdar Nasrullah
Khan’s mission to England in ’95, which was chiefly
to obtain consent to an Afghan envoy being
appointed in London. As this meant dealing over
the head of the Indian Government, it was negatived
by the English authorities. Also the letters he
received from the Indian Government, concerning his
participation in the Afridi rising on the borders, in
August, ’97, were bitter to him. One, which plainly
hinted at the loss of his throne, if such happenings
occurred again, he read out in public durbar held for
the occasion, and to which all leading men were
summoned, and after reading it, he accused his
people of doing that which brought upon him disgrace
at the hands of his ally. About this time he
sent for me, and spoke for several hours on the
Afridi rising, and the trouble the border tribes had
caused him, and seemed particularly bitter against the
Haddah moullah, Maulavi Najmudeen Aghondzada,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
who was the principal instigator of the rising.
He said that since he came to the throne, rebellions
had been frequent, and though each revolt
had been put down with a strong hand (those who
know the Amir’s methods will understand what his
“strong hand” meant), it had not been sufficient to
prevent further risings, for his people were not only
the most unruly, but the most fanatical of all people.
As to his having participated in forwarding the rising,
the Amir argued that the people once risen and
flushed with any little success, would become beyond
the control of any man, and there were old scores to
be wiped off between the border tribes and the
Afghans, so that any rising was a menace to himself.
And in addition to this, a rising in one part of the
country would undoubtedly lead to similar risings
and revolt in other parts, and it was only by his firm
ruling and the stringent methods adopted towards
those who sought to agitate the people, that the
country was kept quiet.</p>

<p>The Amir said that no one knew to what country
the Haddah moullah belonged, for he had no known
relations, and during Shere Ali’s reign the moullah
had been allowed to do much as he liked with the
people, and raise revolt at his pleasure. He himself,
however, had made inquiries, and found out the
moullah’s mode of procedure, and had arranged to
capture him, but the moullah received timely information
of his intention, and escaped across the
frontier, where he shortly afterwards raised the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
Shinwari and other tribes against him, and for some
months gave considerable trouble, and it was not
until four thousand or so had been killed that the
tribes were quieted. And this was the man whose
actions he was held responsible for.</p>

<p>The Haddah moullah had great influence with
the tribes, the Amir said, and had sent agents to
the Jelalabad and Laghman districts, where they
induced some three thousand men to join them, but
the governor of Jelalabad got news of it and stopped
them, and on asking by whose permission they were
going on this jihad (religious war), they replied that
they were told by the agents of the moullah the
Amir had given permission. The Amir said that
of their leaders he had four sheikhs and two maliks,
who carried the green jihad flag, in prison in Kabul,
and he knew what to do with them, but the other
leaders had escaped.</p>

<p>It was on this occasion that two men were
brought in before the Amir as refugees from India,
who had returned according to the amnesty issued
by the Amir a few years before to all who had
been driven out of the country; but the Amir said
that the men were lying, and he had ample proof
that they were spies from Ayoob Khan, who wanted
reports of all said and done in his durbar. He said
that both Ayoob Khan and Yakoob Khan yearly
spent large sums of money in trying to get information
of what he was doing, and to show how little
he feared their influence, the Amir said: “If they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
will pay their money to me I will send them weekly
or monthly reports, and give them all news of what
happens, and my reports will be true ones, for no
one else knows what I do or intend doing, and not
even my most trusted officials know of any secret
matters of importance.”</p>

<p>The Amir’s great wish, as he often expressed it
when I have been in durbar, was to make his
country rich by developing all its resources and
bringing it on a level with other countries, and
had he been gifted with health no doubt much
would have been done towards it; but he was confined
to his room mostly, and had to depend on
his officials for information, and they proved a poor
staff to lean on.</p>

<p>In another letter the Amir received about this
time from the Indian Government, he told me that
it was written that he had been faithful for twenty
years, and yet in the same letter it was also written
that he was buying too much war material, and
that the Parliament in England would perhaps get
suspicious. He could not reconcile these two statements,
and said he came to the country as ruler
without arms, and was recognized and acknowledged
as Amir by the English, and his first act as ruler
was to help them in providing for General Roberts’
army on its march from Kabul to Kandahar by
giving orders all along the route to the maliks, and
others in authority, to bring in provisions for the
English army at each camping place, and in no way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
to molest them, whereby the English were enabled
to march rapidly and without trouble to Kandahar.
According to his treaty with the English it was
necessary for them to furnish him with the latest
arms to enable him to stand as her ally between
her and Russia; but, instead of having them given
to him, he had bought war material himself, and
was now told not to do so. When the Russians
extended their railway to Khuskh, they asked him
to take advantage of it by trading that way, and
he sent a copy of the letter to the Indian Government,
asking what answer he should give, and they
replied, “Give no answer;” but he was forced to
reply or it might end in trouble or war, so he
replied to the Russians that they had constructed
this railway without consulting him, and had they
done so in time he would have asked his merchants
and people their opinion and what they wished, but
they had made the railway for their own convenience,
and his country did not want it, as their
camels and pack-horses were sufficient for their own
needs. He said he sent a copy of his reply to the
Indian Government, who wrote back to say he had
done well. He said he did not blame the English
officials for what they wrote, because they were
under the orders of the Parliament, but his idea of
the Parliament was that it was like the Kabul public
hamam (Turkish bath), where many are speaking at
once, and the reverberations of sound from the big
dome overhead mingles one man’s talk with that of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
others, so that all sequence of speech is lost in the
confusion of sounds.</p>

<p>The great Boer War had just commenced at that
time, and the Amir said he had spent several nights
in anxious thought, for it seemed possible that the
Russians might take advantage of this to advance
through his country on India, but when he put
himself in the place of the Russians and viewed the
situation from their side, and he had spent many
years in exile in Russia, and knew them and their
ways and policy, he found much to fear from
Afghanistan, for a war with them meant a general
rising of Islam, which would spread to Russian Asia,
and they had not enough troops for all that this
meant, for the Mussulman countries she had conquered
were insecurely held, and the people hated
their conquerors, and as the Afghans would prefer
death to being enslaved, and their women and children
taken, it would be too great an undertaking to
quell these risings, and fight Afghanistan and India
at the same time.</p>

<p>About the Boer War he said he was very much
grieved to hear of the number of troops lost. He
had had a large experience in fighting, and from the
different pictures and plans he had seen, he thought
the fighting arrangements were not good, for the
Boers were entrenched and hidden, and the English
advanced on them in the open, and as the bodies
of men are not made of steel, it is impossible to
stand against the hail of bullets which modern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
weapons storm out every minute. He said he could
send fifty thousand troops to help the British, but
Afghans are unused to ships, and would be demoralized
if sent in them, but England must always remember
that he was ready to fight for her on his side or
in India. He once told me an anecdote of the time
when he was in Russia, and the Russo-Turkish War
was raging. He was asked to join the Russian army
with his followers in this war, for they told him they
had heard that he was a great general, and would
like to test his powers. But he was in no mood
to fight for the Russians, particularly as they were
fighting against his co-religionists, so he replied that
to fight on their side would give them no opportunity
of testing his merits and bravery, for all the Russians
were brave and good fighters, and he would be one
among many. Therefore it was better they should
let him fight on the enemy’s side, and then when
he was fighting against them, his ability, or want
of it, would be made apparent, and they could
judge for themselves. They asked him no more,
he said.</p>

<p>In speaking of the foregoing matters the Amir
said these and other anxieties were hard for one
man to bear. He had to be strong enough to
fight Russia both for the sake of his country, and
because of his treaty with the English, and yet he
was told he was buying too much war material.
He tried to keep on the best of terms with his
ally, and was told he stirred up the tribes to fight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
against them. Then, again, he had many reforms
at heart for the benefit of his country, and his own
officials were unreliable, and he could not ascertain
the true wishes and views of the people, so that he
might alter those laws which pressed upon them,
and help them to better themselves, and yet he
must strive that his people live in peace, security,
and prosperity.</p>

<p>Although Amir Abdur Rahman was an exceptionally
able man, he had received little or no education
and training, except in the hard school of adversity,
and the history of his adventures and adversities
until he was made Amir would form a stirring
romance. He was undoubtedly the strongest ruler
Afghanistan has known, for when he came to the
throne lawlessness reigned and had reigned for all
time throughout the country, and no man’s life was
safe who could not protect himself, and when he died
a solitary traveller might journey from one end of
the country to the other in safety. He was also a
man of great personal courage, as those who fought
against him knew, and he was relentless in vengeance
for any wrong done him.</p>

<p>He told me an anecdote one day of when he was
at war with other members of his family and had
lost all but a remnant of his followers. He had
taken refuge in a village fort, and one of his followers
had treacherously betrayed his whereabouts to his
enemy, who came that night with a large number of
soldiers, and surrounding the fort, clamoured at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
gate for his surrender. He was without provisions
for his men and horses, and was greatly outnumbered,
so that fighting was useless, and he determined on
stratagem as a means of getting out of the difficulty,
for his capture, he knew, meant death. So putting
on a large posteen (sheepskin coat) which covers the
body down to the feet, and is usually worn at night,
covering the head as well as the body, he had himself
let out of a small door at the side of the fort, and
with a pistol in his hand which he kept hidden under
the sheepskin he mingled with the soldiers outside,
who did not molest him thinking he was one of
themselves. Eventually he came to where his enemy
was standing, and watching his opportunity when
none of the others were near he seized him from
behind, and clapping the pistol to the back of his
head, ordered him to make no outcry or instant death
would follow, and then by roundabout ways he
led his prisoner to the small door he came out from,
and got him into the fort. Here, as a condition of
life, he made him give orders from the wall for his
followers to retire to a considerable distance, and
thereafter he effected his escape and got clear away
with his men.</p>

<p>The Amir was a good judge of character, and was
fond of reading the characters of men he had never
seen from their photos, and in those cases where I
knew the men, whose photo he was studying, his
reading of their character was mostly correct. He
had a great admiration for Gladstone, Bismarck, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
McMahon, and said they were the leading men of
their time. There were few generals he admired,
subjecting most to a good deal of adverse criticism,
but General White’s defence of Ladysmith, he said,
was the most brilliant achievement of the Boer War.</p>

<p>There are five sons of the Amir living; Habibullah
(the present Amir), and Nasrullah (who was sent
to London), both sons of one wife; Aminoolah, the
son of a Chitrali wife; Mahomed Ali, the son of a
Turkestani wife, who has lived mostly in Turkistan,
and is seldom heard of; and Mahomed Omar, the
son of the Queen-Sultana. The Amir, although
always treating his sons in a kindly manner, was
never familiar with them, and his attitude towards
them was that of king to subject, rather than father
to son. If they committed a blunder or offended in
the discharge of their duties, he punished by ordering
them not to show themselves in durbar, and so kept
them under the ban of his displeasure for a longer
or shorter time, which he ended by sending them
an order to come to him, and then the one in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
disgrace would come and kneel before his father,
and be allowed to kiss his hand in recognition of
forgiveness.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus11" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus11.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>PRINCE INIATULLAH (ELDEST SON OF AMIR
  HABIBULLAH KHAN) AND STAFF.</p>
  <p class="right">[<i>To face p. 120.</i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Amir gave his sons high official positions
with proportionate salaries, but in no way allowed
them to become influential, or to exercise unlimited
power. Many of the chief officials had greater
authority than the Amir’s sons, and treated the
princes with scant courtesy, particularly towards
the end of the Amir’s reign. Sirdar Habibullah
was the nominal head of the army, and chief officer
of all workshops; Sirdar Nasrullah was head of all
the offices and mirzas (writers or clerks), and the
others held minor appointments.</p>

<p>The princes held their own durbars, which many
officials and officers attended, either in connection
with their duties or to “salaam” the princes. They
all had separate houses situated in the new part
of the city, and the two elder ones had country
houses also, in which they used to spend part of
the summer. Sirdar Nasrullah, after his return
from London, had his salary increased, and shortly
afterwards built a new house for himself on the
lines of the house he had stopped in during his
stay in London (Dorchester House in Park Lane).
In arrangement and upholstery, the house was the
best in Kabul, and on its completion, the Amir
stopped there for a few days as the prince’s guest,
and was delighted with it all, for the Amir greatly
admired good architecture, and his own buildings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
were the only innovations on the old mud and brick
dwellings common to the country, which had sufficed
for former rulers.</p>

<p>All the members of the royal family, that is, the
whole of the Mahomedzai family, received an allowance
from the Government. Four hundred rupees a
year (about £12 10<i>s.</i>) was allowed to each boy, and
three hundred to each girl, and food from the royal
kitchen was also supplied to the greater number of
them; but this was stopped under the <i>régime</i> of the
present Amir, and a further allowance in money
granted instead. The greater scarcity of food, and
its consequent dearness, was the chief reason for
doing so.</p>

<p>The officials of the Government and others
attached to the Amir received salaries of from two
hundred to six thousand a year, and although many
have incomes derived from their own lands, they all
live beyond their apparent income, the surplus being
obtained in ways best known to themselves; usually,
the greater the rascal the greater the income.
Formerly the salaries of the officials were paid by
barats (orders) on the revenue due from different
lands in the country, and the officials had to collect
this themselves, whereby the expenses of revenue
officers were spared the Government. But eventually
one of the highest officials used to buy up all these
barats, charging so much per cent. discount, and
collect the whole, a proceeding profitable to himself,
but detrimental to the interests of the country, as his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
agents left the ryots (cultivators) nothing to live on,
more often than not, and caused many of them to
leave their bit of land and seek employment elsewhere.
This wholesale robbery by the collectors of
revenue is one of the chief causes of the present low
state of the exchequer.</p>

<p>Officials are given titles according to the work or
department they have charge of, but in addition
many receive the title of colonel or brigadier, or
other military title, without being attached to a
regiment, and these are called Civil officers. All
officers of the army and officials are given a feast
once a year, on the occasion of the jeshan, or
celebration of the anniversary of the Amir’s title of
“Light of religion and faith,” and on this occasion
all men are received in durbar, and are afterwards
given a dinner, and as the palace will not hold all,
the bulk of them sit in the adjacent gardens, and
their dinner is served to them there.</p>

<p>The officials in their treatment of the English
residents in Kabul, reflect the mind of the Amir and
his attitude towards the English Government, and
when the Amir happens to be prejudiced against the
Indian Government, on account of their attitude
towards him being firmer than is consistent with the
consideration he considers due to himself, the English
in Kabul are included in his displeasure, and all
officials follow the lead of their master by being scant
of courtesy, to the verge of rudeness. At other
times, when the English are in favour, the officials<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
are profuse in their offers of service. Among themselves,
when one official is in high favour with the
Amir, and they all take their turn at that, for no one
of them is in favour long, the favoured one is fawned
on and flattered by all the rest of them, but in their
hearts they hate him, and plot his downfall at the
time they flatter him.</p>

<p>The Law Courts of the country, if they can be
called so, are divided into two sorts. Offences against
or cases pertaining to their religion are first tried in
the court of the Khan-i-Moullah (chief moullah), and
if beyond his powers, are referred to the chief Sirdar,
and afterwards to the Amir. Offences against the
law are tried in the court of the Kotwal (city
magistrate), and those cases beyond his powers are
also referred to the chief Sirdar, and again by him, if
beyond his jurisdiction, to the Amir. For social
offences persons are tried by their peers; the
commoner by commoners, and the khan (chief) by
khans. To the above courts the present Amir has
added a special jury to try those cases which would
otherwise be referred to him, and this jury, although
given special powers to act, must send their findings
to the Amir for confirmation. The present Amir has
also formed a parliament consisting of about thirty
heads of departments, who discuss the laws requiring
reform, and when, after the discussion, a majority is
in favour of any alteration, the proposed new law is
written down for the sanction of the Amir, who afterwards
confirms it or otherwise, but mostly otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
in those cases I heard of. To the parliament is
also delegated the trial of those cases which involve
the sifting of much evidence, and take time, the
finding of the parliament, as in other cases, having
to be confirmed by the Amir. Another jury has
also been appointed to try those cases of prisoners
who have been imprisoned without trial, of which
there are many in Kabul, where prisoners of all
sorts generally average between twenty and thirty
thousand, with orders to report fully to the Amir
on each case.</p>

<p>For the last ten years of his life the gout that the
Amir suffered from gradually took greater hold of
him, and he could walk but very little, and had to be
carried whenever he went any distance, while for the
last two or three years he was unable to stand, and
had to be carried about, even in the room. He got
gradually weaker also, through the repeated attacks
of illness, which came on at shorter and shorter
intervals, and gradually, too, his brain became
affected, until it was only at times that he was able
to think or reason clearly. In this condition he had
to rely still more on his officials, and eventually the
power of the government practically lay in the hands
of three of them, who in the Amir’s weakened condition
had gained his confidence, and were able to
turn his mind in any direction they pleased. These
men, as the habit of the country is, usurped the
power they had while it was theirs, until their conduct
became so arrogant that they made themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
very unpopular. One of them even went so far as to
take away by force the carpenters and carts at work
on Sirdar Habibullah’s new house, giving the Amir’s
name as the excuse, and knowing the Amir was not
in the condition to properly listen to his son’s complaint,
even if the son had the audacity to place the
matter before his father. This man was degraded
from his office soon after Sirdar Habibullah became
Amir.</p>

<p>Eventually, in the spring of 1901, Amir Abdur
Rahman suddenly had a stroke, and it was thought
that it was all over with him; but he rallied, and
lingered on until some six months later, when, on
October 1, he died, and it was said that his feet
were dead a few days before, and the stench from
them was such that no one could stop long in the
same room with him. On the day when the Amir
lay dying, and it was seen that there was no hope of
recovery, Sirdar Habibullah and Sirdar Nasrullah,
together with several of the leading officials, held a
consultation, and decided upon the steps to be taken
immediately the Amir’s life had passed, for trouble
and revolt were confidently expected as soon as it
became known for a fact by the people that the
Amir was dead, and also it was expected that the
Queen-Sultana would try to get the army to side
with her in getting her son Mahomed Omar crowned
Amir; she had a good deal of influence, and was
popular with most people. It was decided at this
council that Sirdar Habibullah was to succeed his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
father, and that when the Amir was dead he should
at once occupy the fortified palace of Arak, in which
is the treasury, together with the stores of modern
arms, for the possession of that would make him
practically master of the situation, and when there,
even should the soldiers rise, as was feared, there was
the possibility of holding out until matters quieted
down, and terms could be arranged.</p>

<p>At the time of the Amir’s death, which occurred
at night, all the princes and the leading officials were
present in an ante-room of the Baghibala palace,
where the Amir lay, having been present from the
afternoon, when they were summoned from their
council with the announcement that the Amir could
not last much longer. When those who were watching
came in and announced that the Amir was dead,
one of the chief officials present took the late Amir’s
hat, and putting it on Sirdar Habibullah’s head,
declared him Amir, upon which all present, taking his
hand in turn, gave the vows of allegiance, and called
him Amir, and another of them, going into an adjoining
room, where Sirdar Mahomed Omar sat, brought
him in, and told him to acknowledge the new Amir,
which he did, giving the vows as the others had.
That official earned the Queen-Sultana’s undying
hatred for doing this.</p>

<p>The new Amir then went to the city, with most of
the officials and his own followers, and occupied Arak,
having already arranged matters with the brigadier
in charge of the picked troops there, and who was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
soon after raised to the rank of colonel. Sirdar
Nasrullah Khan was left at Baghibala that night to
superintend the removal to Arak of all furniture,
carpets, ornaments, etc. This he did the same night
by carts, and in the morning he brought in the
Amir’s body to Arak also, but while doing so was
escorted by a strong force of cavalry, in case the
news of the Amir’s death should have leaked out,
and a rising be precipitated by the sight of the body
being carried in.</p>

<p>That day, too, the furniture of the Queen-Sultana
was sent from the harem serai inside Arak to her
palace, Gulistan Serai, just outside the walls, and
the new Amir’s wives were installed in Arak. It
was then publicly announced that the Amir was
dead, and all offices, works, and shops were closed,
and it was also announced that the funeral would
take place that day. In view of possible emergencies
the guard of seven men with each European was
doubled the day the Amir lay dying by another
guard from the Ardeel regiment, from whom are
drawn the outer guards for the royal palaces and
harems, and who are looked upon as reliable men.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>AMIR ABDUR RAHMAN KHAN.</p>
  <p class="right">[<i>To face p. 128.</i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It was confidently expected by the people of all
classes in Kabul that the death of the Amir would
be the signal for a general insurrection, in which
the army would lead, and, no doubt, it was not
mere conjecture which led all people to expect it.
To safeguard themselves as far as possible against
the consequences of such riot and revolt, the people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
buried their jewels and treasures in the floors of
their houses, and got in as large a supply of flour,
food, and fuel, as they could afford. They also
brought out all the arms they possessed for each
man intending holding his own house as a fort
during the riots. Wild-looking, scantily dressed
men came down in numbers from the mountains,
carrying battle-axes and old flintlocks, and overran
Kabul and the roads round about, for the news of
the Amir’s death had acted on them like the sight
of a dead carcase on vultures, and caused them to
flock round from great distances in an incredibly
short space of time to see what loot was going.
These are the people who are feared by the inhabitants
of Kabul when disturbances set in, for they
come in thousands, naked, practically, and having
nothing to lose but life, which they value little,
loot all, rich and poor alike, for the poor of Kabul
are like princes for wealth to them. They even
demolish houses for the sake of the wood used in
their construction, and the house in which I lived
had once been rased to the ground by them, and
been rebuilt by the Government.</p>

<p>I was told that there was a plot on foot to get
the Amir’s body on the way to the tomb, which
he had built outside Kabul at Kila Asham Khan
some years before, and cut it into pieces that dogs
might eat it. (This is looked upon as the greatest
evil that can befall the body of a Mussulman.) The
road from Kabul, leading to Kila Asham Khan, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
the hills along the route, were black with people
about two o’clock that day, waiting for the funeral
procession to pass, and there was a general air of
suppressed excitement among all the people as the
time fixed for the funeral drew near, which showed
itself in a quickness of movement and alert look,
foreign to their usual leisurely style, and betrayed
the nervous excitement under which all laboured.
However, news of all this having reached the
authorities, the late Amir’s body was buried instead
in the east wing of the Boistan Serai Palace, which
is just outside Arak and alongside the Queen-Sultana’s
palace, and the day passed without anything
untoward happening.</p>

<p>There were six Europeans in Kabul at the time
of the Amir’s death—Mrs. Daly, the lady doctor,
Mr. Fleischer, a German (murdered there in 1904),
with his wife, child, and nurse, and myself—and
the question was discussed as to what should be
done in case of a rising, and although we talked
the matter over thoroughly, we could see no
means of escape from the city or the country,
and there seemed nothing to be done to safeguard
ourselves but to decide on getting all together in
one house as soon as rioting started, provided we
had sufficient time to do so, and barricade and
defend that as long as possible, for the European
residents would be among the first to be attacked,
and the guards could not be depended on to fight
for the infidel against their own people when once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
order was overthrown. We knew that, so long as
the soldiers remained faithful to the Amir, there
would be no rising which could not be easily quelled,
but if the soldiers rose against the Amir, then the
guards, with the Europeans, would no doubt shoot
down the kafirs to begin with, and, in fact, one of
the guards threatened a servant of Mrs. Daly’s that
as soon as fighting commenced, they would kill the
servants of the Europeans first, and the Europeans
afterwards. I had obtained a quantity of Martini-Henri
cartridges from the workshops for the use
of the guard with me in case they were attacked
by the people, and at the time of the funeral they
were very anxious I should serve these out to them
at once; but I preferred waiting to see the course
events would take before giving them the means
to make themselves dangerous to me, and others
with me, in the event of the army revolting, and
told them to keep their minds at rest, for the
cartridges would be served out in time enough for
use when wanted. Undoubtedly the soldiers were
ready to revolt, and intended doing so, if any one
could be got to lead them, and each regiment expected
the others to commence the rising, and were
ready to join them when they did so, but there
was no combination among them, and no man had
sufficient courage to take the lead. The officers of
the guards, who came round to my house on the
day of the funeral to see that all precautions for
safety were taken, and posted some of the guards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
on the roof whence they could command the neighbouring
houses, told me to be ready for any emergency,
as from all they heard it was likely enough
that I, with many of themselves, would be killed
before the night. Also, to prevent any disturbance
being precipitated by an attack on the Europeans,
the other Europeans and myself were told to keep
in the house, and not go into the bazars on any
account.</p>

<p>On the day following the burial of the Amir,
October 3, 1901, Sirdar Habibullah, the eldest son of
Amir Abdur Rahman, who was then about thirty-two
years of age, was formally made Amir. The
ceremony took place in the Salaam khana, outside
the walls of the Arak palace, in the presence of all
the princes, officials, principal army officers, chiefs,
and khans of tribes. There was no display of colour,
and the princes, officials, and others who had them
wore black clothes, while others had white clothes
and some those of a dark colour. It is not the
Afghan custom to wear black as mourning, except on
the death of a king, and it is then worn for three
days. The ceremony consisted of two parts, the
religious and the civil.</p>

<p>The religious ceremony was performed by the
chief moullah of the Juma Musjid, and was commenced
by all those present joining in prayers.
Then the moullah wound a lungi (headcloth) of
white muslin round the Sirdar’s head, after which the
Koran and holy relics of the Prophet (a coat and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
some hair) and a flag from the tomb of a saint were
presented him, after which the moullah announced
him to be the duly elected Amir of Afghanistan.
The flag from the tomb of a saint was one brought
by the late Amir from a holy grave in Turkistan,
all such graves having poles on which small flags and
streamers are fastened, stuck in the ground around
them. The late Amir had camped near by when on
his way from Russia to Kabul, and during the night
had dreamed that he would be successful in his quest
for the throne of Afghanistan, and so had brought
one of the flags from the grave as both a memento
and a charm.</p>

<p>The civil ceremony was performed by Sirdar Nasrullah
(the new Amir’s full brother), who placed the
late Amir’s hat on the new Amir’s head. This hat
was of black Astrakan skin, and on one side of it was
the diamond star, presented to the late Amir by the
members of the royal family on the occasion of his
receiving the title of “Light of Religion and Faith.”
The late Amir’s belt was next fastened round his
waist and his father’s sword was presented him. The
hat, sword, and belt which had previously been worn
by the new Amir, were given to Sirdar Nasrullah,
and Sirdar Nasrullah’s hat, sword, and belt were given
to Sirdar Mahomed Omar, who was the youngest
son. The Amir then made a speech, in which he
said that he intended to hold the country intact,
to resent foreign aggression, and to put in hand such
reforms that the people of the country would become<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
prosperous, and he would also abolish the hated spy
system, which had till then prevailed, and by which
no man was safe. A great cheer was raised on this, a
very unusual thing for the Afghans, but the abolition
of the spy system meant peace and security for them
all. The oath of allegiance to the Amir was then
sworn on the Koran by all those present, and the
ceremony ended in the customary way by all partaking
of food. For weeks afterwards the city was
full of men from different parts of the country, chiefs
of tribes, governors of cities, head men of villages,
etc., all come to take the oath of allegiance to the
Amir, and to all who did so, the customary “khilat”
or robes of honour were given. These are something
in the fashion of cloaks, made of brown, blue, or
green cloth and embroidered with gold braid. Some
of the men were so poor that they were dressed
in little better than rags, which were washed clean
for the occasion, and wore mocassins of undressed
leather instead of boots, and they all looked a little
sheepish and yet proud, as they strolled about the
streets in their khilat. Many tailors are constantly
kept at work in Kabul making khilats, which are
given to any one whom the Amir desires to honour,
and some of the khilats are very rich, being made of
a fine hand-stitched cloth imported from Cashmere,
and heavily embroidered with gold lace and lined
with silk and fur. These khilats cost many hundreds
of rupees.</p>

<p>All the leading moullahs of the country were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
collected in Kabul, and to them khilats were also
given, and the new Amir paid them much attention,
for the moullahs are an influential section of the
community, who are able to sway the minds of the
people and lead them in any direction they choose.
Three or four of the oldest and holiest of the
moullahs were appointed to stop at the late Amir’s
tomb and pray there, and it was afterwards said by
some of the people that the tomb, to which all had
access to pray for his soul, had blue flames coming
out of it, and this was a sure proof that his spirit
was in Hades. However, the tomb was three times
set on fire by some persons unknown who wished
to disgrace it, and that caused it to be commonly
said that the heat of the Amir’s soul was the cause
of the fires. It was impossible for an able ruler
like the late Amir to forcibly bring a lawless people
into the right way of behaviour without making
many hate as well as fear him, and those who feared
him when alive were not slow to try and disgrace
his name when dead, and beyond the power of
retaliation.</p>

<p>The soldiers, however, were far from satisfied
and content, and on the day Sirdar Habibullah
was proclaimed Amir before all the troops, the
Momundzai regiment raised the battle cry, but it
was not taken up by other regiments and nothing
came of it. The men of the Ardeel regiment, who
were against any disturbance or revolt, were repeatedly
asked by other regiments to join them in rising,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
being told that if they did not do so, the rest of
them could do nothing, for the rising must be
universal, and they did not want to fight one against
the other, but with the object of doing away with
the present reigning family and getting other government,
but the Ardeel regiment remained true to
their king, and refused to have anything to do with
it, but many of them were dissatisfied and inclined
to side with the rest of the troops, most of whom
openly said that if the English came into the country
they would not fight for their present ruler, but
would put down their arms and go over to them.
The new Amir, to quell the discontent of the army,
made known his intention of increasing the pay of
all men, and I overheard some of the soldiers in
the workshops discussing what they would do if
he did not keep his promise, or the increase was
not sufficient, and no doubt their attitude was
representative. Their pay was eight rupees Kabuli
a month (5<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>), and one man said that nothing
under twelve rupees a month would satisfy him,
and if he did not get that he would join the others.
The pay of the soldiers was raised soon afterwards
to ten rupees Kabuli a month; but the increase was
considered insufficient, and the discontent continued,
and on the following Roz-i-Eid, when Sirdar Nasrullah
inspected the troops, in place of the Amir who was
unwell, and gave the men the customary greeting
in the name of the Amir, no one responded, and
for a time the situation seemed critical, but Sirdar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
Nasrullah went on with the inspection as though
nothing had happened, and the review passed off
without anything further of an unpleasant nature
occurring.</p>

<p>The new Amir made many promises of reform
which were not fulfilled, and the winter following
his accession to the throne was a dry one, and
practically no snow fell. This caused a failure of
the supply of water from melted snow in the
mountains which was necessary for irrigation during
the ensuing spring, and consequently the crops
failed. Famine of course followed, and very many
of the people died of starvation. Then cholera came
at the time food was scarcest, and thousands were
carried off in a few weeks, and the general discontent
among the people increased, for all the misery they
suffered was put down to the Amir as being an unlucky
ruler. Some plots aimed at the Amir’s life were
discovered, and the Amir kept himself close in Arak,
and seldom showed himself, spending much time in
the harem serai reading private reports from spies,
and leaving the Government business to take care
of itself, and this further increased the discontent.
Also, fearing treachery, he allowed no one but
specially appointed men to come into his presence,
and for people who had complaints to make, he
instituted a system whereby a stamped paper, on
which to write an application, was to be purchased
from the Kotwali office, and it was promised that
such would receive attention. They were, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
written, to be placed in a box outside the Kotwali
station, whence they would be collected by the
Kotwal daily and forwarded on to him. But the
people complained that although it was stated that
such applications would be answered at once, they
had to pay for stamps and yet got no answer, or
if an answer was given, it was indefinite and neither
granted nor refused their request, so eventually the
system fell into disrepute, for the people argued,
why spend money on a stamp when it is most
probable that we shall get no redress?</p>

<p>Under the late Amir it was usual for people to be
allowed to present petitions when meeting him on the
road, or returning from the musjid on a Friday (the
Mussulman Sunday), and this he encouraged, and he
even went so far when he first came to the throne as
to call all men, even sweepers, “brother.” The new
Amir, however, would not allow it, and had proclamation
made that any man who petitioned him on
the road would be imprisoned, and this was done to
some who disregarded the order. The consequence
was that the people felt themselves cut off from their
king, for they could get no speech with him, and their
written complaints were neglected, so they must suffer,
whatever happened, without hope of redress, and then
they lost heart, and that the Amir Sahib had forgotten
and cared nothing for them. The Afghans, in
many things, are a long-suffering people, and their
religion, which teaches them that the Amir is their
spiritual head, and may do as it so pleases him, is no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
doubt responsible for their putting up with a state of
affairs which would cause any other people to take
matters into their own hands; but they are very
clannish, and will suffer from one of their own chiefs
that which would rouse them to frenzy from any
one else.</p>

<p>The present Amir is fond of outdoor sports, and,
considering his bulk, for although not more than five
and a half feet in height he is very stout and broad
and has rather short legs, he can stand a good deal
of exercise. His principal amusement is cooking, and
this is general with all other men of the country, and
it is said that he can cook better than those appointed
for the work. Fridays are usually devoted to this
amusement, all his retinue helping in the preparation
of the viands, which, when cooked, they sit down and
eat together. The Amir also drives his own dog-cart
at times, and occasionally goes out hawking and
shooting. Formerly, when game was plentiful, he
not infrequently used to camp out for a few days,
but since his coming to the throne he has done very
little shooting, and then of an evening only.</p>

<p>Once, towards the end of the cholera epidemic, he
went out to his shooting-box at Pul-i-Bagrami, about
six miles north-east of Kabul, and stayed there for
several weeks, his attendants, together with the
officials and guards, having to live under canvas,
where they had a cold time of it as the winter
approached. While there, one of the state elephants
went “mast” (mad) and, killing his mahout, raged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
through the camp, putting all to flight who came in
his way. The Amir’s shagrassi, a relation of his own,
and by way of being a bit mad-headed himself, called
to the Amir that he would kill the elephant, and,
seizing his sword and springing on his horse, he
shouted to some twenty sowars or so to follow him,
and together they charged over to the elephant, but
the latter, when he saw them, charged them in turn.
The Afghan horses cannot stand elephants, and scattered
in all directions when they saw him coming
down on them, and for the next few minutes the
scene was a lively one, with the elephant chasing
first one and then the other, while the frantic efforts
of men and horses to get out of the way, jumping
ditches and watercourses, and crashing through the
hedges of young trees about, caused a good deal of
laughter from the onlookers in spite of the danger
they ran. Eventually the elephant was lured to a
deep pit which had been dug for him and covered
over with boughs and grass, and there he fell in and
lay, trapped. After some consultation it was decided
to give the elephant four pounds of camphor, four
pounds of opium, and four pounds of chirs (a preparation
from hemp something like opium), to quieten its
lust; and this was done. Next morning the elephant
was dead, and this was an unlooked-for result, although
it was a natural one when the quantities of the drugs
are considered; however, the Afghans believe in large
doses of medicine to effect a real cure.</p>

<p>Amir Habibullah Khan takes an interest in tennis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
and cricket, but mostly in cricket, for it resembles the
national game of toop bazee, which is also played with
a ball and flat stick. Another amusement the Amir
is interested in besides cooking is the magic lantern,
for which he has thousands of slides, including those
which give photos of all the most interesting places
in the world. I presented him with a cinematograph,
first giving, on two successive nights, an exhibition
in one of the durbar rooms in Arak. The cinematograph
was installed in an ante-room, the audience,
with the Amir, being in the large durbar room with
a wetted screen placed in the doorway communicating
between them on which to project the pictures. The
first evening, when everything was ready, the Amir
was informed and came into the room where I had
the apparatus fixed, and asked me to show him the
working of it. I did so, and he then retired to the
larger room to witness the performance; but before
allowing the entertainment to proceed he charged an
entrance fee to all who were allowed to come into the
room of ten rupees each for those provided with seats
and five rupees for those who had to stand. When
I heard this I thought it probable that I should be
given a share of it as a reward for giving the entertainment;
but he kept it all, and it rather typifies the
character given him by his people.</p>

<p>The position of Kotwal (city magistrate) has from
time immemorial been an office of high standing in
the East. In some countries, the Kotwal has the
power of ordering death, but in Afghanistan only the
Amir can punish by the extreme penalty. One of
the duties of the Kotwal, however, is to see that all
executions, public and private, are carried out, also to
conduct those tortures which are inflicted to make
men confess their crimes, or the names of their
confederates, and to see that all punishments for
offences committed are properly administered. In
addition he has to look after all city arrangements,
to superintend the police, to try all cases
brought before him, either criminal or civil, to
receive the reports of and supervise the street kalanturs
(headmen), and keep a record of births and
deaths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

<p>The Kabul Kotwali office is built alongside the
dome of the Arak bazar, the newest bazar in the city,
which is close to the Arak palace, and where the best
goods in Kabul are to be obtained. There are,
besides the chief Kotwali office, several Kotwali
(police) stations in the different streets in Kabul, and
other police stations, which are principally for the
purpose of stopping runaways, and to collect the
custom duties on all goods entering the country, are
placed along all the chief roads right up to the
borders of neighbouring states, and in this way the
police are able to keep a check on all persons leaving
or entering the country. In Kabul itself all
custom duties are collected by a special department
appointed for that purpose. In each police
station is a guard of seven Kotwali sepoys (policemen),
including the havildar or sergeant, who is
supposed to be a man who can write but very often
cannot, and so has a friend or relation among the men
with him who writes all reports. There are other
officers higher in rank than the havildar, and all of
them, officers and sepoys (police), follow the usual
custom of the country in taking advantage of their
position, in order to abstract money or goods from
all the people they are brought into official contact
with, and to invent excuses to do so in other cases.
It is a common occurrence for a person caught in the
act of committing an offence against the law to bribe
the Kotwali sepoys to let him go free, and any of the
sepoys will do this, provided there are no witnesses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
who can give information to a higher officer and so
make trouble.</p>

<p>The policemen are themselves the greatest thieves
in Kabul, and take anything they can get, great
or small; but they become most indignant when
they see others stealing, considering it, perhaps,
an encroachment on their privileges. In going
along the bazar a policeman will take a handful of
grain or fruit from a shop as he passes and eat it,
and the shopkeeper must say nothing. If a shopkeeper
should make a fuss over anything a policeman
does in that way, it is more than probable that
a case will be trumped up against him very shortly
afterwards, and if there is nothing else to accuse him
of, he is accused of giving short weight, and as there
are few correctly made sets of metal weights in
Kabul, those there are being made and used in the
Government workshops and stores, the shopkeepers
have to take stones of different sizes, and after
matching them against the Government weights use
them for weighing out the articles they deal in.
These stones are therefore readily changed by the
policeman for others lying on the street, when taking
a shopkeeper through the bazars to the Kotwal for
trial, and when such convincing evidence is forthcoming,
the shopkeeper is of course heavily fined, and
for the future treats a Kotwali sepoy with every
respect. In most of the robberies committed in
Kabul, some of the Kotwali sepoys are concerned,
their duties as policemen enabling them to mark the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
most likely shop or house, and also to obtain correct
information of the movements of the people in them.</p>

<p>The Kotwali guards at the different stations are
supposed to be changed every two weeks; but when
on guard at those places which give little work for
them, or where they can more readily add to their
income, they endeavour to be kept on there, and
those who possess the favour of the Kotwal, manage
to do this at times. These sepoys are the men
employed by the Kotwal in the carrying out of
executions and punishments, and those who happen
to be on guard at the time are appointed for the
work. Some of the younger sepoys are very sick
after assisting in some horrible punishment, but use
hardens them, and after a time they become callous
to suffering in others, in some cases even to the
extent of gloating over the death or tortures they are
ordered to inflict on some miserable wretch.</p>

<p>Outside the city are also soldier guards from
various regiments, but these are mostly posted about
Arak and the new part of the city. Both these
guards and the Kotwali guards have, in the present
Amir’s time, been much increased, so that in some
places one is challenged every hundred yards or so at
night. Kotwali stations have also been lately placed
on all roads about four miles out of the city to prevent
any one leaving without a road pass, so that no
one can now travel even five or six miles out into
the country without permission. At times, on distant
stations, the Kotwali sepoy on guard is attacked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
and killed at night for the sake of his rifle, and the
body of one of them who was killed at Baber (which
is only two miles south of the city), was hacked to
pieces, possibly because he made a good fight for his
life and injured some of his assailants.</p>

<p>The prisons in Kabul are not buildings erected
for that purpose, but any house belonging to the
Government which is suitably situated is used as a
prison, and continues in such use. Strong bars are
fixed across the windows to prevent the escape of
those who are confined there, and the outer door is
made strong and padlocked, and has a guard of
Kotwali sepoys stationed inside it. The space at
disposal in such houses is very inadequate to the
number of prisoners; but that is not regarded at all
by the authorities, who would laugh at the idea of
properly housing such animals as prisoners, nor do
they insist on the prisons being kept clean, or in any
way healthy. There is absolutely no thought of
sanitation, and the prisoners are herded together in a
house that has perhaps been used as a prison for
twenty or thirty years, and never cleaned. Consequently,
typhus and other diseases are common
among prisoners, and typhus alone will very often
sweep off seventy to eighty per cent. of the men
confined there, and the wonder is that all do
not die.</p>

<p>A man who was in prison for some years described
it to me. He and his father and some other relations
were chained together, and so brought from a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
distance to Kabul, charged with some political offence,
and put in prison there. It is very seldom that
prisoners charged with such offences are tried at
once, if at all, so they lay in prison for some years,
and had no hope of ever getting out, for their relations
and friends feared to bring the matter to the
notice of the Amir in case they should themselves
incur his displeasure. The room they were confined
in was a small one, and they, with the other prisoners,
were about thirty in number, and, when lying down
at night, there was only sufficient space for them to
lie in rows, side by side. Sanitary arrangements
there were none, and at length typhus broke out, and
one after another succumbed to it, his father and
some of his brothers and cousins being carried out
for burial among others. He himself was ill with
the fever for weeks, but recovered, and when the
disease at last stopped, there were only five of them
left out of the original number. Other prisoners
were, however, brought in, and the room was packed
again very shortly, and some of these got the fever
from time to time and died.</p>

<p>At that time also, a number of prisoners were
being secretly disposed of, and almost every night a
man would be called from their number, and going
away with his jailers, was never heard of again.
This made the rest of them live in terror, for no man
knew but what his turn might come the next night.
Eventually the strain was too much for them, and
they determined on revolt and escape, as death in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
trying to escape was no worse than sitting and
waiting for it to come to them. So one night, about
three o’clock, when the guard was known to be lax
and most of the soldiers asleep, they got out of the
room and made their way to the gate. Here the
man on guard saw them and fired, dropping one
man, but before he could reload, a huge Afghan who
led the prisoners, took him across his knee and broke
his back, and then seized the rifle and bayonet. The
rest of the guard were roused by the noise, and a
short fight ensued, and several of the guard being
killed, the others fled; but some of the prisoners also
suffered during the struggle. The door of the prison
was now unguarded, and the prisoners escaped, but
the guards who had run away had warned others,
and they had not gone far along the streets before
these were upon them, both in front and behind, and
after a struggle they were overpowered and taken
back to the prison. For this several were hanged,
the big Afghan among them, and the rest had such
heavy chains put on them that they could hardly
move. It was not until several years had elapsed
that the man who told me the foregoing was released;
but eventually his friends brought his case to the
notice of the Amir, and as there was no proof against
him, and the governor who had imprisoned him had
been hanged, he was released, but his health was
shattered, and he died a few years later.</p>

<p>The food given by Government to the prisoners
is bread, two nans (flat loaves weighing about half a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
pound each) being given daily, one in the morning
and one at night. This is far from sufficient, and if
a prisoner has no friends or relations to send him
either food or money, he is in a bad way. Towards
each other, however, the prisoners, and all the poor
people generally, are very good, and a man who has
food to eat, however little, will offer some of it to
another who has none. Prisoners have leg-irons
fastened round their ankles to hamper their movements
and render any attempt at escape more difficult,
but the hands, except in case of a man being
taken to execution or as a special punishment, are
free. In all cases prisoners are treated by their
guards with great severity, and the prisoner who
does not do at once as he is ordered, gets the butt-end
of a rifle in the small of his back as a reminder.
From what I have seen I should imagine that a street
dog’s life is a happy one compared to theirs.</p>

<p>Of all the prisons, the worst and most dreaded
is the old well in Bala Hisar. This is an old well
which has been excavated through rock, with the
bottom part widened out to some fifteen or twenty
feet in diameter, and having over the mouth of the
well a hut, in which a guard of sepoys is kept. In
this underground hole men are imprisoned for life
for very heinous offences (in the eyes of the authorities),
and live and die there, the bodies of the dead
being left where they lie together with the living.
There are no sanitary arrangements of course, for
none but prisoners are lowered down, and those who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
are put down stop there. Food (bread and water)
is lowered by a rope once a day to those below,
but there are few whose minds or health do not
give way in a short time, and most of the men
imprisoned very soon end their days by dashing
themselves against the rock, until they become unconscious
and die, for the solitude and horror of it
all drives them mad. The bottom of the well is
dark, and the only light which penetrates is from
the mouth above, and no sound from the outer world
can reach those imprisoned there, while the stench
and foulness of the atmosphere is horrible, and is
itself sufficient to cause death. There is a man,
however, who is said to have been there for fifteen
years or more, but he is quite mad, and unconscious
of his surroundings. When the Amir died, the
present ruler gave orders that those in the well
should be taken out, and brought before him. There
were three who were alive, and their appearance
was not prepossessing, for their faces had a dead,
white look, and their eyes seemed to be blind in the
daylight, while their hair and beards were long and
matted, and the hair falling over their faces gave
them a wild, animal look, which their finger-nails
increased, for they were long and more like talons.
The Amir ordered the men to be released, but some
three weeks after again ordered them to be taken
back to the well, the representations of others having
convinced him that his father’s action in so imprisoning
them was just.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>When the late Amir came to the country from
Russia, he brought with him an admiration of the
Russian spy system, and incorporated it into his
system of government. Consequently, every fourth
man was a “reportchee” (spy), who sent in his
private reports to the Amir. These spies were of
all classes and ranks, and every large house had
one or two spies among the servants who reported
all they saw and heard, and as it is the custom of
the country for servants to sit in the same room as
their master, where they sit near the door to show
their inferior position, and as they are allowed to
express their opinion on any subject which their
master and his friends may be discussing, they of
course hear all that is said at any time, and
should they be sent out of the room while their
master speaks to any guest in private, then that
itself would be unusual and suspicious enough to
warrant reporting to the Amir. The Amir had
spies in the houses of his sons, and among the
women of their harems, and spies in his own harem
too, while his wives and his sons in their turn,
had their spies among his servants, who informed
them of all that concerned themselves. It was an
expensive system, and one of which the spies unscrupulously
took advantage to make false reports
against those they hated or feared, and have them
put out of the way. Also for monetary considerations
they would similarly dispose of another man’s
enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<p>The offence which in the eyes of the late Amir
was the most deadly and unforgivable was the writing
by any one of reports concerning himself and his
country to the Indian Government, and this was the
favourite accusation of those of his spies who had an
enemy to dispose of, and they showed a good deal of
cunning in the preparation of the plot whereby their
victim should be doomed, without chance of escaping
the Amir’s vengeance, and devoted to it much
thought and time. Their schemes were usually outlined
on the plan of following up their own report to
the Amir, which gave details of how they became
cognizant of the fact of the accused reporting to the
English Government, and gave as proof the bogus
letter or report alleged to have been found by them,
by other reports, which they obtained by sending to
their friends in India, and elsewhere, a draft of what
they wanted written to the Amir, with instructions to
copy it and send on to him a few weeks later. By
these means they managed to get letters to the Amir
from different places, each accusing their victim of
being an English spy. And when one letter after
another came, each one confirming the other, naturally
the Amir was deceived, and it was not long
before the accused was in prison, and there became
lost, for his fate, though guessed at, was seldom
known; the custom being to remove such men at
night, either by poison, bayonet, or cutting the
throat.</p>

<p>The method of cutting a man’s throat is simple<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
but effective; two men hold the man’s arms, and
force his head back, while another, or two more if the
man is a strong one, hold his legs. The officer in
charge then slices with his sword backwards and
forwards across the man’s throat until the gash
is considered deep enough, and then the man is
thrown on the ground and left to kick, as a fowl
does under similar circumstances, until death occurs.
In some cases the head is severed from the body in
the same way, when the Amir’s orders are to that
effect.</p>

<p>In other cases, when a man is ordered to be
executed by having his throat cut, his grave is
dug ready, and when the knife has done its work,
he is thrown into it, and the earth is shovelled
in at once, so that he is buried before death
occurs.</p>

<p>False reporting, when found out, was a great
crime in the eyes of the Amir, and such men were
speedily punished with death. In some cases where
a man has been wrongly killed, the old well was
given the offenders to consider their crimes in. I
was once in the Amir’s durbar, when fifteen or sixteen
prisoners and others were brought in. Those
who were prisoners were accused of false reporting,
and the other men were their accusers, and six or
seven of the prisoners had been submitted to the
torture of the “fanah,” which is administered as
follows:—A post, about six inches in diameter, is
split into two pieces in the direction of its length,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
and the two halves are put together again, and bound
with rope for one half of the length, so that when
finished it somewhat resembles a huge clothes-peg.
The bound end of the post is firmly fixed in the
ground, with the split part projecting above the
surface, and the foot of the person to be tortured is
tied to the upper end of it with thin cords, which
pass round both the foot and the post, and a
V-shaped wedge is inserted in the slit at the top.
Then, when the wedge is hammered down, it makes
the two halves of the post widen out, and puts a
strong tension on the cord, which binds the foot and
post together. When using this instrument of
torture the wedge is tapped down until the cord
exercises a slight pressure on the foot, and then the
questions concerning the matter requiring confession
are asked, and if the tortured one refuses to speak,
the wedge is hammered down a little further,
making the pressure of the cord still tighter on the
foot, and so the wedge continues to be hammered
down until the sufferer reveals all he knows (and
sometimes much that he does not know, in order to
save further torture), or until the toes are practically
severed from the foot, when the other foot is similarly
treated. There are many who have lost their toes
through mortification setting in afterwards, under
the torture of the “fanah,” without confessing what
they knew, and this speaks well for the endurance of
the average Afghan, but the boast of the true Afghan
is that he can endure pain, even to death, without a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
sigh or sound, and some do so. Another form of
torture is to cover the top of the head with dough,
which is turned up at the edges to form a cup, and
into the cup so formed, boiling oil is poured; the
agony as the brain begins to bake may be imagined.
There are other forms of torture also, but these
cannot be described.</p>

<p>In this case the men who were brought before
the Amir, after undergoing the “fanah” torture,
were hardly able to stand, and their feet were
swathed in bandages and rags, and one of them fell
in a faint while the examination was on, but the
Amir said he was shamming, and told the guards
with them to make him stand up; so they struck
him savagely with the butt ends of their rifles, and
kicked him back to consciousness, but he looked
ghastly ill, and swayed about as he stood. Eventually,
after the hearing of much contradictory evidence,
several were ordered to be hanged, and the others to
be imprisoned, pending decision as to their punishment.
One of the condemned men stopped as he
was being led away, and cursed the Amir, wishing
him every evil he could think of; but the guards
struck him across the mouth several times, and
dragged him out. The Amir looked at the man with
his teeth showing in the savage grin he had when
angered, but, after a few moments, smiled and turned
to me, and spoke on other matters, apparently having
dismissed all thought of what had taken place from
his mind. But to sentence a few men to death, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
listen to their views on the matter as they were
led away, was no new experience for the Amir.
Many men cursed him as they were being executed,
for one of the national traits of character is vindictiveness.</p>

</div>

<p>The Amir once told me, when speaking of the unruly
character of the people, and the difficulty of making
them, by the example of others who were punished,
become peaceful and law-abiding, that he had ordered
over a hundred thousand to be executed since the
beginning of his reign, and that there were still
others who thought they could set his laws at
defiance. The Amir ruled his people with an iron
hand, and, considering their character, such is
necessary, if order is to be maintained. I was one
day in durbar at the Bagh-i-bala palace, and one of
the soldiers committed some offence, and was ordered
to be brought in by the Amir, who inquired into the
circumstances, and then instructed one of his officers
to take the man down the hill adjoining the palace,
and cut his throat there. This was done, and two
little slave boys, who went with the executioners<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
to see the tamasha, came back with white faces and
trembling limbs. It was the first time they had seen
such a sight, but those who were attached to the
Amir’s court, were not long in his service before
becoming used to happenings of this sort.</p>

<p>Although the Amir punished many small offences
with death, he was not always enraged when one
man killed another, unless the murdered person
happened to be one whom he knew and liked, then
his anger was ungovernable, and the murderer was
generally ordered death in some particularly horrible
manner. One of the slave boys, of whom the Amir
was very fond, and had raised to a position of
influence and power, and who consequently became
arrogant and overbearing in manner to others, and
so gained for himself a good many enemies, was
shot by a soldier one evening while riding across
the square in Sherpur cantonment. When the
soldier was brought before the Amir, the latter,
suspecting that he could have had no enmity against
the slave boy, questioned him as to who instigated
him to commit this deed, and the soldier refused
to answer. This further enraged the Amir, and
he gave orders that the man was to be tied to the
bough of a tree by his hair in the palace garden,
and so many square inches of skin taken off his
body daily until he confessed.</p>

<p>The man died on the third day without confessing
anything to incriminate another, but the
name of one of the generals was mentioned freely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
by the people as the instigator of the crime, in
revenge for the slave boy insulting him in the
Amir’s presence shortly before.</p>

<p>Another case showing the severity of the Amir
towards the relatives of those who escaped his
vengeance was that of an old man brought before
him, whose son had run away from the country.
The old man’s son, with two or three others, had
been concerned in, or accused of, swindling the
treasury, and knowing what was being said against
them, and the fate in store should they be convicted,
they determined on escaping to India. The
Kotwal, however, got wind of their intention, and
came on the night proposed for escape with some
twenty of his men, and posted them outside the
gate, where some horses belonging to those in the
house were standing ready saddled. The son, and
those with him, discovering that the Kotwal and
his men were lying in wait for them, determined
on cutting through them, so, suddenly opening the
door, they rushed out armed with swords and revolvers.
The Kotwal was not noted for personal
courage, and the Kotwali sepoys generally are
seldom courageous, perhaps through being of mixed
races, and they gave way after one or two of their
men had been cut down, and then the young fellows
made a dash to the horses, and cutting down those
who held them, mounted and got away, and were
not heard of again. The father, who was left in
the house, was seized by the Kotwal and taken to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
the Amir, where, not knowing whether his son had
escaped or not, he begged the Amir to forgive
him, urging that he was guiltless of the crime of
which others had accused him, and offered his own
life if his son’s might be spared, saying the Amir
might kill him himself where he stood. The Amir,
enraged at the young men escaping his vengeance,
seized his stick and struck the old man down with
it, and then ordered others there to go on beating
him; and in the Amir’s presence the old man was
thrashed until he was dead, and his body was afterwards
exhibited on a charpai (bedstead) in the bazar
for two days, as a warning to others. The Amir
invariably punished the nearest relatives of those
who ran away to escape punishment, and knowing
this, many a man returned and gave himself up in
order that his relatives might go free.</p>

<p>Beating with sticks is a common punishment,
so many blows being given on the man’s back as
he lies spreadeagled on the ground, two soldiers,
one on either side, administering the blows, while
others hold the man down, and sometimes the Amir
orders the blows of such a number that the man
shall die under the punishment. A master carpenter,
who did not get on with the work ordered in a new
part of the palace, was given a hundred and fifty
blows with sticks, and died the day after, but the
sticks used are at times so heavy that the bones of
the back are broken and the flesh mortifies, so that
a less number of blows will sometimes cause death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>The present Amir had fifteen Kotwali sepoys
beaten for neglect of duty, in not reporting the
transgressions of their superior officer, until eight
of them died under the blows, and the others were
unable to move for weeks after, and being kept in
prison received no medical treatment to alleviate
their sufferings. On a later occasion, when one of
his attendants had committed some mischief, with
the object of getting the blame put on another
fellow-servant, and was detected, the Amir, who
was at the time on the temporary roof covering the
new palace in the Arak garden, had the man brought
before him, and there beaten with sticks until partly
insensible, then the man was hauled to the edge of
the roof and thence thrown to the ground, after
which he was dragged by a rope fastened to his
legs from where he lay to the Kotwali, but life
was extinct on arrival, though he was still living
after being thrown from the roof.</p>

<p>The present Amir is very scrupulous about all
things surrounding him being kept clean and tidy,
not only in the house and garden, but the roads
leading to the palace must be kept swept and clean
too. He was one day passing out of one of the
smaller gates in the wall of the Arak garden, and
noticed that the ground round the gateway was
unswept; so, stopping there, he sent for the man
whose duty it was to sweep the place. A woman
came in reply, and said that she was the man’s wife,
and her husband was too ill with fever to get up, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
she had been so busy attending him that she had
found no time to sweep the place herself, and also she
was, as he could see, heavy with child. The Amir
replied that he would relieve her of her burden, and
ordered the woman fifty strokes with sticks on the
abdomen. The woman was accordingly laid on her
back, on the ground, and beaten, and died almost
immediately afterwards.</p>

<p>The late Amir was very savage in punishing those
who falsely reported his death. When the cholera
epidemic broke out in 1900, the Amir went to live at
Paghman, which is situated at the foot of the Hindu
Kush, while the epidemic was raging, for the Amir
and all his family greatly fear cholera, and run
away at once from the affected area. Towards the
close of the epidemic, two men came in to Kabul from
Paghman, and gave out in the bazars that the Amir
was dead of the disease; and when the Amir returned
to the city a few days after, he had these men caught
and brought before him, and said the wish was
certainly father to the report which they had spread;
so he ordered them to be cut in pieces, and their
remains to be exhibited in the bazars as a warning to
others. On another occasion when he had again
been reported dead, he ordered the man who spread
the report to be taken to the top of the Asman
Heights, and there, on a part overlooking the river
which is very precipitous, be put into a barrel and
rolled down the mountain-side to the valley below.
A similar case, but more brutally executed, was that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
of an old man, a moullah, who had given out that the
Amir was not a true Mussulman, and was ordered to
be thrown down the mountain from the same point.
When thrown over the cliff, by the Kotwali sepoys,
his clothes caught on a jutting rock, which suspended
him, and prevented further fall, and the sepoys,
releasing the clothes, took the man back and threw
him over again, this time successfully.</p>

<p>The Amir, after the style of the Mikado of
dramatic fame, always tried to let the punishment fit
the crime, although his punishments were sometimes
such as to make one think that he greatly exaggerated
the crime. For instance, a man who stole the
food of some poor children, leaving them nothing, was
put in a cage, in the bazar, and there starved; but to
make the punishment fit his crime more closely, bread
and water were brought to him two or three times
each day, and placed just out of his reach, and this was
continued until the man died of starvation.</p>

<p>In another case, a man and a woman, who loved
not wisely but too well, both being married people,
determined on running away together, hoping thereby
to secure their future happiness in each other’s
society, but in their endeavour to reach India, where
they intended living together, they were caught and
brought back. The Amir, in ordering their punishment,
said that, as the man was so fond of the woman,
he should have her as completely as was possible. So
the woman was thrown alive into a huge cauldron of
boiling water, and boiled down to soup, and a basin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
of this soup was given to the man, who was forced to
drink it, and after drinking it he was hanged. In
this case the Amir’s object was to punish, not only in
this life, but in the next, for a cannibal cannot enjoy
the delights of Paradise as depicted in the Koran.</p>

<p>Another man and woman, who were caught in
the act of loving unwisely, were, by the order of the
Amir, who appropriately said he would let them
live together until death, put on top of the Asman
Heights, tied back to back with ropes, and kept
there until they died of exposure and starvation,
and sepoys were put on guard to see that no one
interfered with the fulfilment of the punishment.
The woman died first, and the man was allowed a
day longer to die in, but as he lingered he was
helped on his journey.</p>

<p>In ordinary cases, when a man and woman are
caught, as in the last instance, both are ordered to
be taken to the scaffold, and there the rope is
adjusted round the man’s neck ready for him to be
strung up, and he stands there while the woman is
put in a sack, the mouth of which is tied, and the
sepoys thrust their bayonets through it and the
woman until no further cry being heard it is known
that death has occurred; then the man, who has
witnessed his mistress’s death, is hauled up and
hanged. In similar cases where the relatives of
the ruling family are implicated, the man is imprisoned,
and no one knows what becomes of him,
except that he is never heard of again, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
woman is blinded or has her nose cut off, or some
similar disfiguring punishment is inflicted, and after
the punishment she is allowed to die or get well
as nature orders without being nursed; mostly they
die, and it is said that those who were once fond of
them, help them to death with a dose of poison,
which is perhaps the kindest thing they could do.</p>

<p>It is a common matter for a man who has grave
suspicion that his wife is unfaithful to cut off her
nose; sometimes they bite it off, as a sign to all of
her unfaithfulness, and to spoil her beauty. This is,
of course, when the lover cannot be located, and
there are no proofs obtainable of her wrong-doing.</p>

<p>In those cases where men were convicted of
outraging girls or women, the Amir was very
savage in his punishments. In one case three men,
so convicted, were buried in the ground up to their
chins, and left there until dead, after which the
dogs were allowed to come and eat them, or as
much as they could get of them. For the body
to be eaten by dogs is regarded as worse than the
punishment causing death, because it cuts off all
hope of Paradise.</p>

<p>“To fit the crime,” the Amir has in some cases
where men are very much married, and are too
fond of spending most of their time with their wives
to the neglect of their Government duties, given
camphor to the men as a punishment, camphor being
known in the country to be antiaphrodisiac.</p>

<p>As a means of putting a stop to the constant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
robbing of Government money in the different factories,
the late Amir had some men who were in
charge of the soap shops and were convicted of
swindling, thrown alive into the soap boiler (which
is one of a large capacity) when in full blast, to
make up the deficit by boiling them down into
soap. The Amir also had men thrown into boiling
oil on occasions; but this was as a punishment,
and had nothing to do with the manner of the
crime.</p>

<p>To punish stealing, one of the usual penalties
ordered by the Amir, besides hanging, was to have
the hand cut off. On the occasion of my first visit
to Kabul in 1889, I was given tents in the garden
adjoining the workshops to live in, it being summer
time; and one day one of the workmen, who are
always searched before being allowed to pass through
the gate when work is over, was found to have a
piece of leather the size of a man’s hand concealed
under his coat. The Amir ordered the man to be
hanged in the factory as a warning to the others,
but on representations being made to him by the
Englishmen who were working in the shops, the
Amir commuted the sentence to the man’s hand
being cut off. Hands are cut off by a butcher, and
usually the stumps, when the hands are off, are
plunged into boiling oil to stop the hemorrhage.
This workman died a couple of days afterwards.</p>

<p>Another common punishment is that of blinding
people. This is the usual punishment of those who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
try to escape from prison or from the country—synonymous
terms almost. The manner of doing
this is to lance the pupils of the eyes, and then put
in a drop of nitric acid, and, to guarantee no sight
being left, quicklime is afterwards added. The
agony endured must be frightful, and in one case
when fifteen men were blinded together in Sherpur
cantonment, where these punishments are usually
carried out, the men were seen on the third day after
being blinded all chained one to the other, and sitting
in a row on the ground; they were unable to go
elsewhere to obey the calls of nature, and consequently
were filthy beyond description. Three of
them were lying dead still chained to the living, and
some of the living, too, were lying unconscious, while
the others were moaning and rocking themselves
backwards and forwards.</p>

<p>Running away was not always punished with
blinding, as was exemplified in the case of five Kafri
boys. These boys, who were part of the regiment
formed of the prisoners brought from Kafristan after
that country was taken by the Amir, tried to get
away to India, for Kabul and enforced Mohammedanism
were little liked by them; but they were caught
while doing so and brought back. As a punishment
the Amir ordered the Kafri regiment to be paraded
and the boys bayoneted in front of their fellows.
There had been a good deal of dissatisfaction among
the Kafris, and the Amir probably deemed a severe
example necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>One form of execution, but which is very rarely
used, is to bend the tops of two young trees towards
each other and fasten them to the ground. The
person to be executed is tied, one leg and arm to
one tree, and the other leg and arm to the other tree,
and, when all is ready, the ropes binding the trees
down are cut simultaneously, and the body of the
person tied to them is disrupted.</p>

<p>There are three common methods of execution in
use—blowing from guns, hanging, and bayoneting.</p>

<p>The latter is mostly done in the prisons at night,
when those to be executed are taken by guards to
some secluded spot, such as the rased portion of Bala
Hisar, and there bayoneted, their bodies being
afterwards thrown into an old well or ditch close by,
and earth thrown over them.</p>

<p>When a person is ordered to be blown from a
gun, he is taken to the one which is fired daily to
announce the hour of midday, and is fixed on a small
hill close to the Sherpur cantonment. He is there
tied to the gun in such a manner that his back is
against the muzzle, and on the explosion of the
charge the greater part of his body is blown into
pieces. Blowing from guns is a punishment intended
to strike terror into the hearts of others, but it is no
doubt a preferable death to other forms of execution,
inasmuch as it is sudden. Men who rob or swindle
Government funds are served this way, and the
Amin-Nizam, or paymaster to the army, is sometimes
the central figure on these occasions, also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
highway robbers and spies frequently end their days
by being scattered from the gun.</p>

<p>For hanging the ordinary gallows is used, <i>i.e.</i>
there is no drop given to break the neck, the man
being hauled up by means of a pulley and hanged till
he dies of strangulation. Two gallows are used, one
T-shaped, and very high, is for a man who is hanged
and left hanging until the following day; the body
being left on the gallows as a warning to others.
The other is a frame similar to the frame of a table
with the top planking removed, the legs being fixed
in the ground, and each side of the square so formed,
has three or four wooden pulleys depending from it,
over which the ropes pass for hauling the body up.
It sometimes happens that several have to be executed
at one time and this gallows was made large enough
to take sixteen persons together. Those who are
condemned to be hanged are not blindfolded at the
time of execution; their arms are tied to the body by
a rope which passes over the arms above the elbows,
and their legs are secured above the ankles. While a
man is being hanged, his forearms work up and down,
one after the other, struggling to break the cords and
get at the rope round his neck, until he becomes
unconscious, and it is a rather gruesome sight to
watch his fruitless struggles to relieve the agony of
strangulation. On one occasion a burly Afghan who
was being hanged managed to break the rope binding
his arms, and then clutching the rope, above his neck,
pulled himself up and let go again, probably with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
intention of ending the torture by breaking his neck;
but the rope broke instead, and the man fell to the
ground, and lay partly unconscious at the foot of the
gallows for twenty minutes or so, while another rope
was being brought from the bazar, and when that
arrived, he was again strung up, and the execution
completed. On another occasion when a man was
being hanged the rope broke three times, and each
time a new rope had to be brought from the bazar.
When the third rope broke, those standing by said it
was a sign from God that the man was innocent and
should not be hanged, and the officer in charge of the
execution despatched a messenger to the Amir with
the particulars of the case, and asked if the man was
to be reprieved; but the Amir’s message came back
that the man must be hanged as ordered, so they had
no alternative but to pull the man up for the fourth
time and hang him until he was dead.</p>

<p>The lesser punishments for offences committed,
besides those already mentioned, vary according to
the caprice or humour of the Amir. In some cases
noses are cut off, beards are plucked out, men are made
to stand for several days and nights without moving.
Snuff is rubbed into the eyes, and in different other
ways they are made to feel the Amir’s displeasure.
Any butcher who was convicted of giving short weight
was, by Amir Shere Ali’s orders, nailed by the ear to
the door of his shop.</p>

<p>In one case, where false witnesses were produced
before the Amir, and were detected, the emissaries of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
the man who engaged these witnesses at a certain
price each to give false evidence were ordered to be
hanged by the heels in the Arak bazar from sunrise
to sunset for eight days; but the men had friends,
and the power of money is great, so the police sepoys
allowed them to rest with their chests on the ground
and legs up in the air until some officer was seen
approaching, when they were hauled clear of the
ground until he had passed, and were then lowered
again, but even with all this indulgence, the men
fainted several times. The strange part of the
sentence lay in the punishment of the man who
wanted, and paid for, the false witnesses, for he was
fined only. No man knows the mind of the Amir,
they say in Kabul, and it would be interesting to know
by what process of reasoning the chief offender was
considered less guilty than those who did his bidding.</p>

<p>Another punishment, which was also a huge joke
in the court for many months, was that of a slave
boy who had asked the Amir several times to give
him a wife, until at last the Amir said, “Yes.”
It was a usual thing for the Amir to give a slave
girl from his harem for a favourite slave boy to
marry. The marriage of this boy was celebrated in
the usual way; a large khirgah or bamboo tent was
fixed in the palace garden for the use of the newly
married couple on the night of the ceremony, and all
passed off with the firing of guns and feasting, as is
usual. When at last the bridegroom hurried to the
tent to see his bride for the first time face to face<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
(the bride is never seen by the bridegroom until after
the marriage ceremony is over), he found the tent
in darkness, but passed in. Shortly afterwards he
rushed out yelling, and fled to the Amir’s presence,
saying that a great calamity had befallen him, and
that it was a shaitan and not a woman he had
married. It transpired that the Amir, to punish the
boy’s importunity, had secretly ordered another of
his slave boys to be dressed up and put in the place
of a girl during the ceremony.</p>

<span class="smaller">LIFE OF EUROPEANS IN KABUL</span></h2>

<p>Life in Kabul—Houses and gardens—Guards and danger from “Ghazis”—Allowances
given wives—Servants and swindling.</p>

</div>

<p>I have often been asked, “But didn’t you find it
lonely in Kabul?” and in giving an affirmative
answer, the memory of the many weary hours spent
alone after worktime is always brought back to me.
In the loneliness of life in Kabul lies its worst
feature, and the effect on one of living such a life
for several years is far from beneficial, but the
extent of the ill effect produced is not properly
estimated until one returns to civilization. There
is no social intercourse between the Afghans and
Europeans, the utmost in this way being a ceremonious
call, on some feastday, by those who are
well disposed towards the English, and this is
generally a compliment for which a substantial
return is expected by those who pay it.</p>

<p>The loneliness is worse in the winter than in the
summer, for then the days are short, and the evenings
from four o’clock until bedtime seem interminable,
and it gets worse as the winter progresses,
for there is little to make time pass but read, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
one gets tired of that when there is nothing else to
do for several hours each day, and especially so
when there is seldom a new book to read. I used to
welcome work which necessitated the preparation of
plans and drawings, because I could do these after
nightfall and make the time pass more quickly; and
when all else failed as a means of amusement, I got
one of the clocks and took it to pieces and cleaned it,
and otherwise damaged it. Another work I left for
the evening was the analysis of ores which were sent
from all parts of the country to the Amir, who
passed them on to me, and I was glad of them as a
means of making time pass. Altogether it is very
different to what it is in India or England, where the
evenings may be passed pleasantly in so many ways.</p>

<p>In Kabul there is no amusement that one does not
make for one’s self, and there is not much to make
amusement out of, unless one cares to make a joke of
tragedies. On Fridays and holidays the day may be
spent in shooting, for most of the summer months
quail and blue pigeon can be got in the fields
outside the city, and in the winter there are plenty
of duck and snipe to be found on the chamans. The
chamans are flat stretches of ground in the valleys,
which are partly covered with water, where grass and
weed abound for water-fowl. The birds, though, are
very much hunted, and are consequently very wild;
but they afford the better sport on that account, as
being much more difficult to shoot. The late Mr.
Fleischer, who was in Kabul during the last three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
years I spent there (he was murdered by the officer
of his Afghan escort on his way to India in November,
1904), used to join me on Fridays, and we made a
practice of spending the day on the chamans. We
used to take eight or ten sepoys with us, as a guard
is always necessary, and the men were useful for
putting up the game, and we also had lunch brought
out to us with kettles and other things necessary to
make tea, so that we could picnic on the shooting-ground
comfortably, and although we seldom got a
decent “bag,” the sport was a welcome variation to
the daily routine of life. In the springtime, when
the duck and snipe shooting was over, and the quail
had not come in, we fixed up running targets for
rifle practice. The target consisted of a life-sized
representation of leopard or deer, roughly daubed
on paper, which was nailed to an upright frame
fixed on a light trolly. A man using a long rope
dragged this trolly over a short length of narrow-gauge
rail, while running at full speed, and in front
of the trolly run we made a fence of young trees,
so that the target could be seen at intervals only.
This made very good practice at eighty to a hundred
yards for snap shooting. When tired of rifle practice,
we used to take the native circular net and go fishing
up the river. The fish obtainable in the river
near Kabul are few and small, and one must go up
the river for some miles if decent sized ones are
wanted, so that we seldom got fish more than three
inches in length, but although those we netted were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
small, they were of a good flavour and resembled
whitebait when cooked. The larger the fish were the
less flavour they had.</p>

<p>In the early part of my stay in Kabul I used
to go for long rides about the country, generally
unattended, for those were the days when Amir
Abdur Rahman was full of vigour, and it was deemed
unwise to meddle with one of his “Feringhees.” I
found, however, that I got enough riding in the
ordinary course of my work, so after a time, I gave
it up. Then I got a bicycle, and used to ride
about the country around on that; but this, too,
eventually became uninteresting when there was
nothing fresh to see and the rides had no objective,
and the day’s work also was sufficient to keep me
in good health so far as exercise went. I afterwards
spent most of my time during the evening in the
garden, except when there was quail shooting to
be had in the fields close by, and I also found that
for two hours before sunset numbers of blue pigeon
used to fly over the garden in twos and threes,
returning to their sleeping place from the fields and
mountains, where they had been out feeding all day,
and as this offered good amusement within easy
reach, I spent most of the evenings, when I had
nothing better to do, sitting in the garden waiting
until one or another came within range. They
afforded good practice, for blue pigeon fly fast,
and, coming from in front and flying over one’s
head, they were more difficult to hit than birds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
flying past on one side or the other. We also made
a tennis court, and during the last two years were
able to play most days until winter set in. One
can play tennis in Kabul until nearly the end of
December, when the snow begins to fall and stops
further play until the following April.</p>

<p>The house I had was one with six rooms below
and six above. All the windows faced an inner
courtyard, round the other sides of which ran the
kitchen and servants’ quarters, stables, hamam, etc.;
I had windows made on the outer side of the house
also, so that I could not only get a view of the
garden, but make the back rooms light enough to
live in. The house was originally the harem serai
in which some of Amir Shere Ali’s wives lived, and
it is the custom in building houses intended for the
use of women to leave the outer walls without
windows to ensure greater privacy. The windows
are therefore always on the side which faces the
inner courtyard. For the same reason the roofs
of the houses, which are flat and are used by the
women to enjoy the air in the evening, have a high
wall round them so that they may not be seen by
other men.</p>

<p>We all had gardens attached to the houses given
us, and mine was a large one; the house, too, was
a large one, and was situated on the outskirts of
the city near Deh Afghanan, where there is land
in plenty. I took a good deal of interest in the
garden, and grew all sorts of vegetables: potatoes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
cabbage, cauliflower, cucumbers, melons, celery,
asparagus, tomatoes, peas, beans, and other vegetables;
all did well in it. I also grew strawberries, of
which fine crops of large fruit were yielded. But
I got little or no fruit from the trees in the garden,
for the seven Kotwali sepoys who formed the guard
on the outer gate of the house most of the time I
was there, took care to make away with all fruit
as it ripened, and as they did so at night or while
I was away on my work I was unable to fasten
the guilt on them, for although I cared little
who had the fruit I was annoyed at it being
stolen.</p>

<p>On one occasion I saw a single apple left in
the thickest part of the foliage of one of the
trees, and I sarcastically told the sepoys with me
that I looked upon that apple as my share of the
fruit, but I would leave it on the tree for a few
more days until it ripened, and I asked them to
see that it was left untouched. They said, “Ba
chashim” (on my eyes be it); but the next day it
was gone, and although all denied having touched
it, no one but themselves had access to the garden.
I mention this to show that the Kotwali sepoys
cannot leave untouched anything they can put their
hands on, provided there is a probability of the
thief remaining undetected. On another occasion
they stole the bridle of my horse, and as this was
serious, for I had but one, I summoned the guard
with their havildar (sergeant), and told them of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
theft, but said I would wait until the morning, and
if it was not found by that time I should report the
matter to the Amir. Early the following morning
one of the sepoys found the bridle lying in some
long grass in the garden, and, as proof, showed me
the spot where he had found it. I said that I had
long suspected that there was a shaitan (spirit or
devil) about the house who was in the habit of
mislaying articles belonging to me, and it was
fortunate that I knew it, for otherwise I might
think that the sepoys stole the things, and bring
“budnami” (ill reputation) on them. They looked
at me undecided whether I spoke sarcastically or
meant it, but it was a long time before anything
else was stolen from the house.</p>

<p>The Kotwali guard with me gave a good deal of
trouble through their thieving propensities. When I
tried to fix the theft on them, for they never let
themselves be caught red-handed, they would in turn
accuse one or other of my servants, and by all combining
their evidence, would show that one had seen
the servant do it, and another one would bring the
man he had sold the stolen article to, and so on, until
they made up a strong case. That the servants stole
things if left to themselves I knew, but I had made a
rule that each man was responsible for the articles in
his charge, and had to make good anything lost, and
this I enforced, so that a servant would not be likely
to steal and sell that for which he had to pay double
the amount he could sell it for. About this time,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
when I was endeavouring to stop the thefts which
just then were very frequent, a particularly bad lot
of sepoys being on guard at the time, the Kotwal
was evidently informed of my endeavours, for one of
my servants was taken to prison accused of stealing
two teapots from a tea-seller in the public garden
close by, and some of the Kotwali sepoys with me
gave evidence that they saw him sell the teapots to a
shopkeeper in the bazar, and brought forward the
shopkeeper and the teapots as evidence. The matter
being taken before the Amir, the servant was ordered
to be put in prison, and the Amir wrote to me to be
careful what sort of men I got for servants, because, if
a man was a thief, he might on occasion become a
murderer, and it was dangerous for me to have such
men about me. Having thus, as the Kotwal intended,
prejudiced the Amir’s mind against my
servants, any complaint I was likely to make of his
sepoys’ stealing would not be listened to, when they
would all swear that one of my own servants was
guilty. Concerning the theft of teapots just mentioned,
I knew the servant to be guiltless, for both
before the time of the supposed theft he happened to
be with me for some hours, and after that until late
at night, helping me while I made a bookshelf.
Eventually I got the man released from prison, but
he would not come back to my service, fearing, he
said, the enmity of the sepoys. However, they
followed their vindictive custom of not letting a man
alone whom they had once accused, and got him back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
in prison some short time after, where, like many
another, he disappeared.</p>

<p>The guards of sepoys given to the European
servants of the Government are called guards of
honour, but they have also to report all that the
European does, where he goes, who visits his house,
or his servants, and all pertaining to him. This is
principally to find out if he is a spy, and sending
reports to the Indian Government, but it also enables
the Amir to find out what manner of man he is.
The guard is a necessary one, to prevent Europeans
being attacked by fanatics, or ghazis, as they are
called, of whom there are plenty about, and from
whom there is now more danger of attack than when
the late Amir was in his prime.</p>

<p>These fanatics care little, provided they kill a
Feringhee, whether they themselves are killed the
next moment or not, for they are then sure of
Paradise, and the houri, and the rivers of milk, etc.
I was attacked by one of them one afternoon in the
workshops, while I was squatting on my heels,
directing some masons below me, who were putting
in the foundations of a furnace. The ghazi came
behind with an empty 9-pounder iron shell in each
hand, and threw one at me with all his force from
close behind; he aimed at my head, but fortunately
I stood up at the moment he threw the shell, and
received it between the shoulders instead of on the
head, and the edge of the shell struck me about half
an inch from the spine. The force of the blow took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
all power from my body for a time, but the sepoy
with me—there was but one of the guards with me
that day, strangely enough—seized the man before he
could throw the second shell, and pinioning his
arms, got him on the ground, while the workmen
gathered as if by magic, and kicked and beat the
ghazi so roughly that he was soon in a semi-conscious
condition. I afterwards sent for the captain of the
regiment on guard in the workshops, and had the
man made prisoner, and put in the guard-room there,
pending the Amir’s orders. He was punished by
being kept for six months with his hands chained
together with a stick between, so that they should
remain about twelve inches apart, and the punishment
included being kept in prison for life. To try
and kill a Feringhee is not a very great crime among
Mussulmans, and the man’s friends very nearly
succeeded in getting the sentence annulled a year or
so later, but I used the influence I had, and their
efforts were not successful. For some days after
being attacked I was unable to move about much,
and paralysis was feared, for the spine was injured a
little; but Mrs. Daly, the lady doctor, attended me
with so much care and skill that I was soon going
about as usual, though for a year or two the place
was tender. The Amir sent his own hakeem (doctor),
with many expressions of sympathy, to examine my
hurt. He came for three days to inquire how I
progressed, and then rejoined the Amir at Paghman,
where he had moved his court, to escape the cholera,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
which broke out the day I was injured. There were
other attempts, but none where I escaped so narrowly,
and these happened in the last three years of my
stay in Kabul, that is, when the late Amir was feeble,
and during the reign of the present Amir, who is not
yet a prophet in his own country.</p>

<p>One attempt, which illustrates the narrow-minded
jealousy of the Kabuli, was in the powder-shop, where
I went in accordance with instructions from the Amir
to put matters in order, the Amir saying that the
powder made in Kabul fouled the bore of the guns
much more than foreign powders did. The man in
charge of the powder-shop was a member of the royal
family, which is a large one in numbers, and he
resented my appointment over his head to the extent
of putting flints with the powder in the incorporating
mills and starting them as soon as I entered the shop
they were in. There is always a possibility of powder
exploding while incorporation is going on, and,
seeing that he and all the others with him remained
outside and left me to go alone into the shop, I
suspected that all was not right, so, going out, I gave
orders for the mills to be stopped, and then I found out
the reason I was allowed to inspect them alone. I said
nothing of this to the authorities, as my report which
showed that the quantities of the ingredients were so
arranged as to prove a source of revenue to those in
charge, would, I knew, be sufficient for all purposes.</p>

<p>Europeans are allowed to take their wives to
Kabul, and the wives are generously given a living<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
allowance by the Amir; but Kabul is no place for
a woman to live in, for there are no amusements, and
there is practically no society for her, and few women
can live happily who see no one but their husbands
from one month to another; consequently women are
forced back on themselves, and get into a low condition
of health, which soon brings out all the ailments
they are subject to. For children the climate
is a good one, and they thrive well. The Afghans
are fond of children, and as they believe that all of
them, no matter of what race, are Mussulmans until
they arrive at the age of reason, European children
are well looked after wherever they go, and are
admired to the extent of a large crowd following
them about the roads and public gardens when they
take their daily outings. Toys are given them, and
their every wish is a law, so that they are very much
spoilt, and usually yell when they have to be taken
from their guards and go into the house to their
father and mother. The change from despot to
subject being one little to their liking.</p>

<p>European women servants are not desirable in
Kabul, for they require looking after too much, and
are, besides, of little use except as companions for
their mistresses. They are treated familiarly by the
native servants and others they come in contact with,
and form acquaintances which are not to their credit.
Those who were brought to Kabul in the early part
of my stay there by the wives of the English residents
were mostly sent away in more or less disgrace, while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
the German nurse, who was taken up there by Mrs.
Fleischer, left her when her services, for which she
was engaged, were immediately required, and went to
the present Amir’s harem and placed herself in the
hands of his chief wife, saying that she wanted to
become a Mussulman, and although Mr. Fleischer
went to the Amir’s palace late that night to get the
woman to return, if only for a day, or until the
trouble was passed, the Amir said he could not use
force to make her do so, but she could return for
a time if she wished, and this the woman refused to
do. Consequently Mrs. Daly had her hands very
full looking after Mrs. Fleischer and the baby all
that night and the next day unattended by any
nurse. The German nurse eventually got a husband,
which was apparently the chief reason of her apostasy,
although at first it seemed likely to be a difficult
matter, for when the Amir called together his
attendants and asked who would marry her, her
face had unfortunately been seen by them, and
none volunteered. In this we see one advantage
of the Afghan marriage custom. The Amir at last
bestowed her on a Kafri officer, whose pay he raised,
and a house was given them to live in.</p>

<p>As there are no Christian churches or clergymen
in Kabul, Mrs. Fleischer’s baby was christened by
her husband, Mrs. Daly and myself standing as
sponsors, and the Amir, in a <i>firman</i>, giving the child
its name. Any written order of the king is called a
<i>firman</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>The English who formerly lived in Kabul were
not unfortunate in having their social status at home
fixed. One lady, the wife of one of the English
<i>employés</i>, on stating that her father was a minister,
had the admission promptly translated by the native
interpreter as “the daughter of the <i>Prime Minister</i>,”
and the other ladies had to keep up to this standard
to prevent themselves being put down as nobodies;
consequently it was a rather well-connected bevy
who graced the Queen-Sultana’s court on occasions.</p>

<p>The servants to be obtained in Kabul are unfit
for anything but the commonest sort of housework,
and know nothing of English cooking or waiting at
table. I took a Hindustani cook and a khitmatgar
(table-servant) up with me, and engaged Hazara
coolies to carry water, sweep, and clean things, and
to look after the horses. After several months’ service
these men got to know their work, but by the
time they had done so and were becoming useful,
they had invariably saved enough money to return
to their own country and start as farmers in a small
way. Some of the Hazaras I had from time to time
who worked as cook’s assistant, were soon able to
cook several English dishes, and do it well, and, no
doubt, if they could have been induced to stop long
enough, they would have become good cooks. The
Hazaras, however, are a truculent lot, and quarrels
with the sepoys on guard were frequent. In consequence
of this quarrelling there was a good deal
of enmity generated, and several of my servants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
disappeared, and I found out afterwards that they
had been put in prison by the Kotwali sepoys on a
charge of being spies, and supplying me with information,
and while in prison were put out of the
way by one or other of the methods of murder in
common use there.</p>

<p>One Hindustani servant who was with me on the
journey up to Kabul through Kandahar, some months
later developed into a drunkard, drinking the raw
spirit which is distilled in the Government shops and
sold to Hindoos in the bazars, as well as being used in
different manufactures. I put up with it for a long
time, but when I found that matters got worse daily,
and not only the work was not properly done in the
house, but a good deal of swindling was going on, I
wrote to some friends in India, and had another man
sent up to replace him. I had kept back part of his
pay for some time to prevent him wasting it in drink
and women, as he was fond of doing, and had given
orders to the sepoys on the gate to stop him going
out at night to other Hindustanis’ houses where cards
were played, drink supplied, and loose women were
kept; but all this failed to stop the man’s misbehaviour,
and when the other servant at last arrived
I obtained a passport to enable him to return to
India, and told him to arrange by which caravan he
would travel, and to see me the day before he started,
when I would give him the wages I had kept in
hand. In the mean time he went to live with some
friends, and two or three weeks passed before he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
came to me one evening to say good-bye, and tell
me that he was starting for India the next morning.
I said good-bye to him, gave him his money and his
road permit, and he went away. A short time after
I found that he had not gone back to India, but had
used the money to get married to a widow—a rather
notorious character—and had been paying daily visits
to my old enemy, the Kotwal, who tried to compromise
me before the Amir through this man. He had
told the Kotwal many lies to revenge himself on me;
but as nothing he said could be proved, the Amir
refused to listen, whereupon the Kotwal clapped the
man in prison as the best means of preventing his
tongue wagging about his own part in the matter of
getting up a case against me, and some few weeks
later had his throat cut at night, and the body disposed
of. Of the sequel I knew nothing for some
months, but eventually a man told me the particulars
related to him by a Kotwali sepoy, of how this sepoy
had been one of those appointed to cut the servant’s
throat late one night, and how the body had been
stripped of its clothing, and then thrown into a ditch
and covered with earth. He said the man’s screams
were fearful when he saw they had come to kill him,
and, knowing his timid nature, I can believe it.</p>

<p>The Hindustani servants I had in Kabul all
swindled more or less, and generally more toward
the end of their service, when I was forced to dismiss
them and get others. I had little time to attend
to household affairs, except at night, and then I was,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
as a rule, too tired to go into matters properly, and
it is not at night that one can thoroughly see to
such things, and I had perforce to accept their
statements, such as the quantity of cattle and horse
food bought and used, without knowing whether the
animals had received all that was charged for, and
being morally certain they had not; so the servants,
seeing the position, took advantage of it, as natives
ever will. Thrashing servants does little good, and
it besides engenders in them a spirit of retaliation,
which shows itself in small things, such as forgetting
trivial household duties, while pretending to do
their utmost to please the sahib, and though these
offences are so trivial, yet when one has other
worries which are irritating they loom large, and
are very trying to bear. In retaliation of this sort
the natives are past masters, and mention of the
small duty forgotten sends them into apparent fits
of abject contrition. Both the servant and one’s self
know it is all humbug, but there is nothing of malice
aforethought to be proved, so the servant retires
gracefully with, when far enough off, a smug smile,
while his master stands and fumes at his impotence
to punish without losing dignity. Those who do not
know the native, and he seems to be much the same
in all Eastern countries, may think that they would
find means of counter-retaliation, but rather than let
matters go so far as that, it is better to get rid of
the servant and try a new man, and this has its
drawback, for one who changes servants frequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
will soon find it difficult to get a good one, and in
native servants there are many degrees of quality.
The general experience of Englishmen in the East
seems to be much the same, except that some fare
worse with their servants than others, and if those
who do not understand the native were present on
some occasions, it is extremely probable they would
think the master most unpleasantly unjust to poor
servants, who were doing their best for him.</p>

<p>If one wants to buy cheaply from the bazar, it is
better to send a native of the country to do the
buying, rather than a Hindustani, for the latter,
being known to be an Englishman’s servant, is
charged double the price asked from any one else.
When a native of the country does the buying, he
always adds something on to the price when rendering
the account, and so does a Hindustani, but
generally the amount of the commission he charges
is less than the other one, and one also saves the
extra price asked by a shopkeeper from the
Hindustani servant. I have tried sending the latest
engaged, and therefore the poorest, Hazara servant
to the bazar to buy things, and in his innocence the
man has charged me the prices asked by the shopkeeper,
who thought he was dealing with a poor
Hazara, and from the prices so obtained, I was able
to keep some sort of a check on the other servants,
and prevent their commission becoming too excessive.
This dustoori, or commission on things bought, is
recognized as quite the right thing by all servants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
when buying for a foreigner, and the poor Hazara,
who charged me no more than what he paid, used to
have a bad time from the other servants when they
found out that he had made nothing for himself;
but a few months’ service and advice from, and the
example of, other servants always corrected such
stupidity. However, I always found the Hazaras more
reasonable in their dustoori, and therefore cheaper
to send to the bazar than Hindustani servants, for
the latter were always grasping to the last degree,
and generally managed to kill the goose with the
golden eggs by their avaricious tendencies, and it
was a great blow to their pocket, to say nothing of
their dignity, when I would take the purchase of
requirements from their hands and appoint some
poor servant to do the work instead, much to the
latter’s importance and swagger before the others.</p>

<p>After the death of Amir Abdur Rahman, a good
deal of lawlessness prevailed in the bazars, which
was principally due to soldiers interfering with most
of the people they met, for the men of the army
looked upon themselves, and not altogether without
reason, as the cocks of the wall, since the Amir’s
death, and of course, did their best to show that they
were not subject to any authority. I had, therefore,
to send one of my guards with the servant, who went
to the bazar daily to make purchases, to prevent the
man being molested, and to ensure his returning with
all the articles he had bought.</p>

<p>Shopkeepers also took advantage of the unsettled
nature of affairs to give short weight, and in
other ways increase their profits, no doubt thinking
it best to make all they could before the disturbances,
which all expected, set in. One shopkeeper took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
half the matches from each box in the packets of
twelve, and sold them in this half-filled condition,
in order to reap a double profit. One of these
packets being sold to one of my servants, and the
fraud detected, the soldier who accompanied the
servant knocked two of the shopkeeper’s teeth out,
whereupon the shopkeeper made complaint to the
Kotwal, who reported the case to the soldier’s commanding
officer, and the affair ended in my being
several rupees out of pocket in obtaining the soldier’s
acquittal. Bribery and corruption, of course; but I
could not let the man suffer for his over-zealous
protection of my interests. He was a simple Afghan
soldier, and such men are usually very straightforward,
and only think of carrying out the orders
given them. I once sent a soldier of this description
to tell one of the workshop foremen to come to my
office, and on the foreman impudently sending back
word to the effect that he was busy and would come
later, I told the soldier to bring him by the beard if
he did not come on being told to do so. The soldier
went off, and presently returned dragging the man by
the beard, the two together making sufficient noise
on their progress to attract a crowd of workmen, who
followed to see the end of the matter. Although I
had not intended my instructions to be literally
carried out, the effect on the rest of the workmen was
that I had no occasion to send twice for another man.</p>

<p>In the bazars it is not an easy matter to get
good meat, the sheep killed for the supply of meat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
being generally the large Turkestani sort, the flesh of
which is tough, and, being also rather flavourless, is poor
eating. For this reason I bought my own, the small
Hazara ones, which much resemble the Welsh sheep,
and having got together a flock of fifty to sixty ewes,
I sent them to Hazara, where pasturage is cheap and
plentiful, and had others bred from them there. The
young lambs were sent down to me from time to
time in batches of eight or ten, to enable me to feed
them up ready for killing, and in this way I got very
good mutton, and each sheep killed cost less than a
couple of shillings on an average, but I paid nothing
for pasturage and no wages, the man in charge
taking the sheep’s milk, from which he made cheese,
in lieu of pay. I also bred fowl, duck, geese,
turkey, and guinea-fowl, and as food for them is
cheap, they were inexpensive, and the fowl provided
me with all the fresh eggs I wanted. I kept a couple
of cows for milk, and the supply of occasional veal,
when their calves grew up large enough to kill. The
cows of the country seldom give a good supply of
milk for long, so that I found it necessary to keep
two to ensure a constant supply of milk sufficient for
daily use, and for making butter. Flour used to be
cheap, but the price for several years past has been
going up steadily, so that it is now three times the
price it was five years ago, and when I left Kabul, it
was selling at six pounds per rupee (a little less than
three half-pence per pound).</p>

<p>Tea, coffee, tinned provisions, tobacco, wines, etc.,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
must be got up from India and usually it takes about
three months from the time ordered before they are
received. The reason it takes so long to get up
provisions is due to the karaya-kash people (carriers
for hire), first in the difficulty in persuading one of
them to undertake to carry the goods from Peshawar
to Kabul, and next in delaying the goods on the road
for many weeks. It very frequently happens that a
man carrying for hire gets a load in Peshawar for all
his camels, horses, etc., part of the load being booked
to Jelalabad, which is half way to Kabul, and the
other part of the load to Kabul. On the man reaching
Jelalabad he delivers the goods which are consigned
there, and leaving there those goods which are
to go further on, he returns to Peshawar for another
load, and he continues going backwards and forwards
until the goods for Kabul are sufficient for all his
animals and then he goes on to that place. As the
journey to Jelalabad from Peshawar takes five or six
days, the various trips to and fro until the man is
ready to go on to Kabul, take time, and if one
happens to be out of tobacco, or anything else one
wants, this prolonged waiting for fresh supplies is
very irritating, particularly when one has been
advised by letter from Peshawar that the goods left
there some weeks before, but when the goods at last
arrive one is so pleased in getting them, that all
former irritation is forgotten. It often happens
that goods are spoilt or go bad on the road on
account of the boxes being left in the serais (caravan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
yards) at different places exposed to the weather, but
there is no remedy, and one has to take one’s chance.</p>

<p>When the tribes about the Khyber Pass rose and
necessitated the Tirah campaign, all traffic between
Kabul and India was stopped, and we in Kabul had
to go without those things which go to make life
comfortable. There was nothing to drink, not even
tea or coffee, and nothing to smoke, and so it continued
for some months. I can go without most
things when necessary, and not grieve overmuch,
although I would rather necessity did not demand
such abstinence, but when there is no tobacco or
cigarettes, then matters seem to be in need of speedy
readjustment, and I shall always remember the time
when the Khyber Pass was closed. The Amir and
the princes were always very good in letting me
have things I wanted when I ran short, but on that
occasion they ran short themselves.</p>

<p>The Amir and his sons were also very good in
sending me occasional presents of game and fruit, the
latter being sent them from other places before they
were to be obtained in Kabul, and the strawberries
they used to send me in the spring before the fruit
in Kabul was ripe was a favour I very much appreciated.
In the spring there was, as a rule, a scarcity of
vegetables, the last year’s supply being finished and
the new year’s not yet in, and I often had to go
without potatoes for some weeks, and that is a dish
I think most people would not care to be without at
dinner; however, when I became accustomed to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
place I made arrangements which obviated going
short in that respect.</p>

<p>During the famine of 1903, when so many thousands
died of starvation, most of the bazar provisions
were very scarce, and some things were not
to be had at any price. Flour was unobtainable in
the market, and I had to buy a supply of wheat
for myself and the servants from the Government,
and have it ground. The Government opened a
depôt and sold a stipulated quantity every day to
the people, as there was none to be had elsewhere,
and it is the custom of the Government to keep
full granaries in case of emergency. The struggles
of the people to be first in getting to the depôt, in
order to obtain a share of the wheat before the
daily quantity allowed for sale was disposed of,
were so great, and the crush so dense, that many,
principally women, were killed, by being knocked
off their feet and trampled to death. The distress
among the poorer classes was particularly great.
Parents, who had sold all there was in the house
that could be sold to get money for food, had to
watch their children crying of hunger, and daily
getting weaker and thinner until at last they died,
while they themselves, if they lived, did so only
because they had more vitality and were stronger,
and not because they ate food themselves and gave
none to their children.</p>

<p>Most of the men under me in the workshops
were starving, and sometimes a man would faint<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
while working, and on my asking what ailed him,
I would gather that he had perhaps eaten about
two ounces of bread in as many days. It was impossible
to help all, but those of my workmen,
whom I knew to be helpless with hunger, I gave
food to once a day, and in many cases it was all
they got until the next day. I saw one man hiding
some of the bread I had given him under his coat,
and the man, being run down to skin and bone for
want of food, I was surprised at his not eating it
all, but he told me that he had a child at home
starving, and there was nothing in the house to sell
for food. He said, also, that the mother of the
child, and other women in the house, had nothing
to eat, but that appeared to be a matter of little
concern, and it was the condition of the child only
that worried him. No one puts much value on a
woman in Kabul, and it is not considered right for
a man to cry for the death of a woman, even
when it is his mother or sister who dies, but they
cry and make enough fuss over the death of any
male relative.</p>

<p>Another day a foreman workman came to me,
and, without the usual salaams, told me he was a
Mussulman, and had seldom asked a favour of his
co-religionists, and never of a Feringhee; but he
had three little children starving at home, and they
were dying slowly, and his fellows would not give
him anything, so he had determined to cut the
throats of his children that night and put them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
out of their suffering, and then kill himself, but
while saying his midday prayers it had been put
into his mind to go first to the Feringhee, and so
he had come as soon as his prayers were finished.
His manner of speech was not polite, and very
much removed from that of others who begged for
help from me, and who usually addressed me as
“Presence;” but I knew the man to be one of the
religious bigots who abound in the country, to
whom an infidel is lower than an animal. However,
I gave him three rupees without remark of
any kind, and the man, without thanking me, but
simply looking dully at the money, went away.
Three rupees go a long way in Kabul, although
they amount to less than half a crown. I thought
no more of the matter until two days after, when
the man came again, and, taking off his turban,
prayed for me; this is the highest compliment and
favour a Mussulman can pay an unbeliever. He
then told me I had saved the life of his children,
and his too, for he had been mad with grief and
suffering when he first came, and he said further
that he had been told much against Englishmen,
but he would always pray now that one of them
might become a Mussulman, and so go to heaven
when he died.</p>

<p>On top of the famine that year came cholera,
and the mortality was very high, for the people
were weak with want of food, and their systems
out of order through eating any rubbish they could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
get to keep off the cravings of hunger. Daily the
roads leading to the burial grounds streamed with
people carrying their dead, and many, I knew, who
came to tell me of a mutual acquaintance whom
they had taken for burial that day, were themselves
carried to the same place the next day, or
a day later. The cholera spread among all classes,
and penetrated even to the harems of the princes,
Sirdar Nasrullah Khan’s favourite wife dying of it,
and among others the Amir’s favourite slave boy
was carried off. Several of the highest officials also
got the disease, and died of it.</p>

<p>The members of the royal family are particularly
afraid of cholera, that and earthquakes being their
chief dread; and during other outbreaks the late
Amir and his family, with all their officials and
attendants, posted off helter-skelter from the city to
Paghman the moment cholera made its appearance.
When the cholera epidemic of 1900 occurred, three
years before the one mentioned above, the late Amir
and all his people went off at once, and the carts
carrying luggage, tents, etc., people on horseback
galloping, carriages driving along furiously, and the
servants and soldiers on foot also hurrying on, gave
to the scene all the appearance of a disorderly flight.
The English (Mrs. Daly and myself were the only
Europeans there at the time) were left behind to get
on as best we could, and she spent the next four
months in the treatment of cholera cases, whereby
she saved many lives, while I occupied myself with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
series of experiments in smokeless powder-making, in
which I was fortunately successful, chiefly because
I was left all this time untroubled and alone.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp48" id="illus13" style="max-width: 28.125em;">

  <p class="right">[<i>To face p. 200.</i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When the 1903 outbreak occurred, the present
Amir, following his father’s example, sent off furniture,
carpets, etc., to Paghman at once, intending to
follow them himself the next day; but in the mean
time the Governor of the city, hearing of his intention,
went to him and frankly told him that if he left
the city, the prevailing dissatisfaction was so great
that the soldiers and people would rise, and he would
never be able to return to it. So the Amir, who
accepted the Governor’s view of the situation, had to
remain in his palace in Arak, and here he confined
himself to two rooms, and allowed only some half-dozen
favourite courtiers and attendants to see him,
but he would not allow those who saw him to leave
the palace, for fear of bringing the infection back
with them. Sirdar Nasrullah Khan, who was, of
course, obliged to remain in his city palace since the
Amir did not go away into the country, spent most
of his time on his prayer-carpet, so I was told by
those who were with him; and when his favourite
wife got cholera and died, he was described as being
almost mad with grief at her loss and fear of the
disease attacking him next.</p>

<p>The prince’s fear, as also that of the Amir, had a
reason, however, which intensified their usual dread
of the disease, and it came about in this way. One
of the chief and most influential of the moullahs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
in the country started on the Haj (holy pilgrimage to
Mecca) in the beginning of that year, and while
going down through India, on his way to the sea-port
where he intended embarking for Medina, he heard
of a holy man who preached the second coming of
Christ—one who said that he, like another St. John,
had been sent on to prepare the way, and make
Christ’s coming known. The moullah went to see
this man, of whom many and wonderful things were
told by the natives about, and the words of the self-styled
prophet were so convincing that the moullah
was converted, and came to believe in the man being
what he said he was. One day, it being known that
the moullah was going on the Haj, the “prophet”
took him into an inner room, and there, the moullah
afterwards stated, the two together visited Mecca,
and he saw himself one of the multitude of pilgrims
at the holy shrine, and visited the inner court, and
saw all there was to see, and said all the prayers
prescribed in the different places before reaching the
inner sanctuary. Whether mesmeric, or other influence,
would account for this hallucination of the
moullah is a matter for conjecture, but even death
could not shake the moullah’s belief that he had been
to Mecca, and that his guide was a true prophet.
The Mohammedans believe that the religion preached
by various prophets (Moses, Christ, Mohammed) are
the true religions for the time being, and that God
inspires a new religion as it becomes necessary to the
advanced needs of mankind, and that, therefore, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
Jewish religion was the true religion until Christ
came, and the religion Christ preached was the true
religion until Mohammed came. This new man,
therefore, if his preaching was listened to, would
upset Mohammedanism, and as he preached that
Mussulmans must regard Christians as brothers, and
not as infidels, this would render useless the Amir’s
chief weapon, Jihad (religious war), in case of English
or Russian aggression. So the Amir, when he heard
of all this, sent word to the moullah to return, and
the moullah did so, preaching the new religion as he
came, and as soon as he was well within the
boundaries of the country, he was made prisoner and
brought to Kabul. Here he was examined by the
Amir, but the Amir could find in the moullah’s
clever replies nothing against the true religion which
would make him an infidel, and therefore worthy of
death, for a Mussulman, according to the Koran,
who becomes an apostate, must be stoned to death.
He was then sent for examination to Sirdar Nasrullah
Khan, who is regarded as more than a moullah in
knowledge of his religion, but the prince could not
convict the man out of his own mouth, and so a jury
of twelve of the most learned moullahs was convened,
and even their examination of the accused could
elicit nothing on which the man might be killed, and
they reported this to the Amir. But the Amir said
the man must be convicted, and so he was again sent
to the moullahs, who were told that they must sign a
paper, saying the man was an apostate and worthy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
of death. Again the majority of the moullahs made
affirmation that he was innocent of anything against
their religion, but two of the moullahs, who were
friends of Sirdar Nasrullah Khan, and had been
talked over by him, gave their verdict for death, and
on the finding of these two moullahs the man was
condemned by the Amir and stoned to death.
Before being led away from the Amir’s presence to be
killed, the moullah prophesied that a great calamity
would overtake the country, and that both the Amir
and the Sirdar would suffer. About nine o’clock at
night the day the moullah was killed, a great storm
of wind suddenly rose and raged with violence for
half an hour, and then stopped as suddenly as it
came. Such a wind at night was altogether unusual,
so the people said that this was the passing of the
soul of the moullah. Then cholera came, and, according
to former outbreaks, another visitation was not
due for four years to come, and this was also regarded
as part of the fulfilment of the moullah’s prophecy,
and hence the great fear of the Amir and the prince,
who thought they saw in all this their own death,
and it accounts also for the prince losing control of
himself when his favourite wife died. The murdered
moullah was a man with a large and powerful following,
and the two moullahs who gave the verdict for
his death lived in constant fear of the retaliation of
his followers, who had sworn to avenge him. One
of them got cholera, and almost died of it.</p>

<p>During the summer months I used to put a tent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
on the roof and sleep there. It was much fresher
and cooler than in the house, for the nights in
summer are hot, and there is little or no wind. As
the roofs of the houses are flat and walled round they
are generally used by the people for such purposes
and to sit on in the evenings, and also the women
use them for exercise and to get fresh air, as they are
not allowed to go outside, and very few houses, and
those only of the wealthy, have gardens attached to
them which can be given for the sole use of women,
because gardens to be of use to women must be
walled round so high that they cannot be overlooked
by neighbouring houses. It is also for this reason
that houses are built in the form of a square with an
inner courtyard where the women are free from the
observation of neighbours; but the courtyards are
usually small and dirty, and the smell from rotten
refuse thrown there makes them unfit for places of
recreation. During the spring, on my return in the
evening from the workshops or elsewhere—for working
hours are from early morning till evening—I used to
spend a good deal of time on the roof attending to
seedlings which were planted in boxes and kept up
there, where they had less chance of being uprooted,
until they were ready for transplanting; and I put
the seeds in at the earliest possible time so that
I might get salads and other things without having
to wait until they were in the market. On the roof,
too, I sometimes amused myself, and any amusement
was welcome, in flying different sorts of kites, and in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
this I was soon imitated by those living near, but
the house being close to the pass between the Sher
Darwasa and Asman Heights I lost several of them
through the sudden gusts of wind which sweep along
the gorge there.</p>

<p>For those who like such things Kabul affords
a good field for the collection of old curios, swords,
knives, shields, matchlocks, chain armour, etc., some
of which are extremely ancient, and from the Arabic
on many of the swords one might imagine them
having been used against the Crusaders of old. Coins
which date back to the time when Alexander the
Great left his governors at different places on the
route when he set out to conquer India can also be
obtained, but a good knowledge of such is required,
as they are counterfeited and sold there. Hindoos,
of whom there are a few hundred resident in Kabul,
usually have the stocks of curios, but they are afraid
to bring them themselves to the Europeans because
of the sepoys, who make them disgorge a good deal
of their profits on leaving the house, and they cannot
very well refuse to give anything when the sepoys
threaten to make up a case against them, and report
that they were carrying information to the Feringhee,
as I have overheard them say.</p>

<p>On great festivals it was usual for the Europeans
to attend durbar to salaam the Amir and afterwards
do the same to the princes. On these occasions the
durbar wore a different aspect to what it did at other
times, for now all present, including the Amir, were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
merry and joking, and pleasantry was the order of
the day. Some of the officials and others would be
sitting on the floor playing chess, and the Amir would
bet on one or the other of the players, and occasionally
give advice as to the move to be made, for the Amir
was a great chess player, and there were few in his
court who could compete with him. The jester of
the court would be in great form, and raise many
a laugh with story and joke. It was on these
occasions that the late Amir would mostly indulge in
reminiscences of his career and talk of the places and
men he had seen in Russia. One, who was a Russian
merchant, the Amir always spoke of with feeling
when relating the good turns this merchant had done
him, for the merchant had on one occasion saved him
from a good deal of embarrassment by a timely loan
of money. The Amir once told me that he had
worked for a watchmaker for some time in order to
learn that trade, having little else to do to amuse
himself, and he related various amusing stories of the
clockmaker’s wife, who seemed to have ruled her
husband in a very strict manner; but the Amir’s
conception of humour was too broad for the stories
to bear repetition.</p>

<p>The present Amir’s court on days of festival lacks
the noise and fun of his father’s, for at all times he
exacts the strictest order and decorum from those in
his court, and he never unbends except to those of
his relations with whom he is intimate, or unless
there are but a few present. He was much more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
approachable before he became Amir, but he was
never fond of noisy merriment, and cared little for
the rude jokes of the court jesters. He is fond of
that which will amuse him in a quiet manner and
help time to pass, and is always interested in the
magic lantern he has, and when that is being worked
he will look for hours at the different pictures projected
on to the screen.</p>

<p>Europeans in Kabul are not looked upon as
amenable to the laws which govern the people there,
but should they do anything which seriously violated
any one of the laws which are common to all countries
they would no doubt be deported to India, but so far
no European resident has offended against any such
law. The late Amir was chary of doing anything
which another country could call in question, and
once when an Afghan petitioned him to help him
recover his dues from the Indian Government for
supplies made to their army during the English
occupation of 1879-81, the Amir thought the best
way to do justice to the man, without committing
himself to any decision, was to appoint six persons
chosen from among the leading merchants in Kabul,
together with myself, to go into the case, but the
man’s papers, which were in English, showed nothing
but a full settlement of all dues. Another case in
which I was appointed as one of the jury was that
of a Continental merchant who came to Kabul to
settle his affairs, who claimed the full amount of
salary specified in the agreement, alleging that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
although the amount of business done was less than
that agreed upon in the contract, which made the
salary contingent upon a fixed amount of business
done annually, he was not responsible for the falling
off, for the business entrusted to him was less than
agreed upon, and the annual salary stated in the
agreement should therefore be paid him, as he had
done the best he could, and had always been faithful
to his contract and to the Government. Letters which
he had written to one of the officials, and which had
been stopped in the post and opened by the Amir’s
order, were, however, produced, which showed that
he, in writing at least, thought little of the Amir’s
promises, and the letters also gave his opinion of the
Amir in a rather bald manner. The Amir therefore
contended that, on the face of those letters, he could
not entrust business to a man who doubted his
promises and had a far from exalted opinion of
himself, and so my presence, together with Mrs.
Daly’s, was considered necessary on the jury, more to
shame the merchant before other Europeans than
anything else. I must, however, say that the letters
showed that the merchant had thoroughly grasped the
character of the Amir’s officials.</p>

<p>In the matter of letters, it used to be a very
common thing for letters to the English in Kabul to
be stopped and read by the appointed Government
spies, and generally, after being read, they were not
sent on—an Englishman’s private letter being a
trivial matter in the eyes of the officials concerned.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
Opening letters to and from the English in Kabul
was, of course, to find out if there was any spying
or reporting going on between them and the Indian
Government, but in the present Amir’s time this was
stopped a good deal, and more of the letters sent
to and from reached their destination safely. Post
letters, however, are never looked upon as very
sacred among the Afghans, and before all post letters
were enclosed in a bag and sealed, with a list of the
letters enclosed, and orders had been given to the
postmasters that the letters of one post were not to
exceed a certain weight, the postrunners used to open
the parcel of letters and throw many down the
mountain-side, in order to lighten the burden they
carried.</p>

<p>I was told of a case which concerned an important
letter. It was from the British Agent to his Government,
and the Amir wanted it, so orders were given
and the post-carrier at a certain place on the road
was killed, and all the letters he was carrying were
taken back to Kabul. The murder and theft was
blamed upon the tribes of the district where the
crime was committed, and this seems to show that
neither letters nor life are held sacred. However,
the Amir got the letter he wanted, and nothing was
said that could reflect upon his integrity.</p>

<p>Letters are carried by men on five-mile relays,
laid between Kabul and Peshawar; each man
running (not walking) backwards and forwards over
his own five miles, carrying outward letters one way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
and in-coming letters the other. In this way letters
are carried between the two places in three days.
The postage is fourpence per miskal, which is about
one-sixth of an ounce, and stamps have to be affixed
to the letters; but the outgoing letters have the
stamps taken off them by the Amir’s postmaster in
Peshawar before being put in the Indian post.
Afghanistan is not in the postal union, and, therefore,
letters to Kabul must have the postage paid on them
in Peshawar or else be paid by the addressee.</p>

<p>When magazines and periodicals are sent to Kabul
the postage on them is a large item, and I once
noticed that the postage I paid on a small magazine
between Peshawar and Kabul (some two hundred
miles) was three rupees, while the postage on the
same from England to Peshawar was a penny.
Letters sent from Kabul to India have to be addressed
in Persian, and Indian stamps must be put
on the envelopes besides paying the postage in
Afghanistan.</p>

<p>One person in Kabul with whom English people
are greatly brought in contact is the interpreter.
There are several interpreters, but only one who is
appointed to interpret between the Amir and the
English residents, and this post is one which involves
a good deal of work, for the man, in addition to
interpreting whenever the Amir or the princes require
his services, has to translate all letters from the
English to the Amir, and <i>vice versâ</i>. The Government
correspondence with other countries is translated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
by others, who are specially appointed for the post,
and they are not encouraged to mix with the English
people in Kabul. To be an interpreter a man must
be quick at catching all inflections of meaning in the
two languages, and must be ever ready to put in a
word of his own in case he fails to hear something
which is said on either side, for the Amir is impatient
of having anything repeated. He must also be, in
a measure, conversant with the subject under discussion,
as otherwise technical words would bring
him to a standstill, and very often such English
words require several sentences of Persian to explain
them, as they have no equivalents except those
adopted from other languages of late years. But
particularly must he be able to interpret all that is
said quickly and without mistake, otherwise he will
be put aside and another man taken on in his place,
and to him this means disgrace for always.</p>

</div>

<p>The first thing that strikes one on seeing a regiment
of Afghan soldiers is their irregular, slovenly appearance
and slouching gait. Their clothes, for they
have no uniforms for regular use, are of any sort and
pattern as the wearer may desire or his purse can
afford. Some have old English army or railway
coats; others have coats of various colours and
materials which have been made in the bazar; and
coats made by the bazar tailors fit where they touch.
Some have cloth trousers, some cotton ones, and
some the Afghan tombons. Many wear the Afghan
tombons with the shirt outside, as is usual in
Eastern countries, and a sheepskin jacket, and this
is the dress more generally worn, particularly among
those regiments which are composed of hillmen. All
of them, of course, have leather belts with pouches on
either side, for neither soldiers nor civilians consider<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
themselves dressed without them, and an Afghan
soldier or civilian who was seen without a belt would
certainly look undressed to any one who had been
some time in the country. For headgear the turban
is commonly worn; but there are different varieties
of caps and hats, of which one that is liked by many
is similar to the Russian military peaked cap.
Cavalry soldiers, or sowars as they are called, wear
long boots of the Russian pattern, with very high
heels, which give the wearers a curious perched-up
appearance; and these boots are much bepatched and
mended. As I do not remember seeing a sowar with
new boots on at any time, I fancy they must all be
bought secondhand. The clothes the soldiers wear
are generally old and much worn, but I have at
times seen a havildar (sergeant) with a new coat, and
as the man has to save up for many days before he
can afford one, he pays great care in the selection of
the cloth, and usually gets it of a vivid colour, light
yellow or blue for preference, which soon looks the
worse for wear, and necessitates the man spending
many a half-hour when off duty in cleaning it. His
old coat he sells to one of the men of his company.</p>

<p>When a regiment is drawn up in line the rifles
are held at all angles, for the men are not drilled as
drilling is understood in other countries, and on the
march a regiment looks like an armed mob rather
than soldiers. In order to obtain a good appearance
during the two annual reviews, the regiments are
marched on to the review ground, and the officers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
then move the men singly into their proper places,
pulling one man forward here and pushing another
back there, until they form a double line of somewhat
varying straightness, and when the review is
finished (the review consists of the Amir, or the
prince as his deputy, riding past the different regiments),
the men are again pushed into place to form
fours, and are then marched off, all keeping their own
step, back to the barracks, and on the road one man
or another joins the four in front or behind in order
to speak to a comrade, so that the little formation
they had is soon upset, and the regiment goes along
as it likes best, and that is—anyhow. The men, after
review or parade, which latter is the same as the
review, except that one regiment only is placed in
line and inspected by its officers, seem to consider
that they have taken part in manœuvres of considerable
intricacy, and appear to be rather proud of
themselves. The men of the Amir’s bodyguard,
however, are drilled. The drill consists in the men,
having already been taught to form themselves into
fours, marching slowly in time to a drum-beat, and
swinging each leg in turn high up in the air in front
of them before bringing the foot down. This drill,
which takes place on the main road outside the Arak
palace, is witnessed by a large number of admiring
citizens, but the spectacle of a regiment solemnly
swinging their legs well up as they march, taking
four or five seconds to each step, reminds one of a
batch of recruits doing the goose-step.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<p>Regiments are occasionally drawn up on parade
and fire volleys of blank cartridges; but there are no
rifle ranges at which the men are trained to shoot.
Some batteries of artillery occasionally have target
practice: but this is more to test guns than actual
training. Those artillerymen whom I have seen at
practice were very erratic in their shooting, and were
seldom nearer than fifty yards of the object fired at,
and when their general sighted a gun himself and
got the target at two thousand yards, he was so
pleased that he had to walk up and down for a few
minutes. The reason men are not trained in shooting
is, I think, because in Afghanistan among all
classes of men a cartridge is looked upon as a cartridge,
and not a thing to be used without necessity.
The only good shots I have seen are the workmen
who test all rifles and guns as they are turned out of
the shops. I have sometimes, when practising, given
the small rifle I was using to one or other of the
soldiers with me to try a shot, and in no case was
any man at all near the target. The hillmen who
are more accustomed to shooting and are sometimes
good shots, lie down and rest the rifle on a rock when
firing.</p>

<p>The Amir’s bodyguard, foot and cavalry, are
the only regiments properly uniformed, and the
Amir sees that they keep their uniforms clean, and
their arms too. The foot-guards are armed with Lee-Metford
rifles and bayonets, and the horse-guards
with revolvers, swords, and carbines. Of the other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
troops, a few regiments of the most trusted men
are armed with Martinis, and the rest have Sniders.
The artillery batteries have six and nine pounder
guns, and there are some mule batteries with six
and three pounders, but the guns are badly sighted
and of short range, the fuzes also are unreliable, and
the shells of small efficiency, so that the artillery
cannot be considered very formidable. The mules
and horses used for the artillery and transport are
strong and sturdy, and are used to mountain paths
and roads, but the transport animals are too few
for the service of a large army. The rifles, which
are made in the Government shops, are also badly
sighted, and hardly two of them shoot alike. If
they are used for firing against a large number
of men massed together, the defective sighting may
not make a great deal of difference; but accuracy
is of first importance in a rifle, and the shooting
of trained troops in action is sufficiently bad, without
leaving much else to chance. Another great defect
is that the powder, which is made in the country,
fouls the bore after four or five rounds so badly
that cleaning is necessary, for otherwise the kick
of the gun prevents straight shooting, and tends
to demoralize the shooter. Maxim and Gatling
guns are also made in the shops, but owing to the
inaccurate fitting of working parts, and the cartridges
not being uniform and exact to gauge, it
is seldom that a full belt of cartridges can be fired
without a stop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span></p>

<p>The pay of the troops is very inadequate, considering
the dearness of food now to what it used
to be. For infantry the pay was eight rupees
Kabuli a month, until the present Amir, on his
coming to the throne, raised it, to keep the troops
contented, to ten rupees a month (6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>). Cavalry
receive thirty rupees Kabuli a month (20<i>s.</i>), but
have to find their own horse and its keep out of
that. The Amir’s foot-guards receive thirty rupees
a month, and are men envied by the rest of the
troops because of their princely incomes. The
soldiers were far from content when the Amir
advanced their pay by two rupees only, for they
expected more, and talked of what they would
do if they did not get it; but the Afghans are very
much like sheep, and unless there is one to lead
the way, they remain where they are, and do nothing
but bleat occasionally. For each active service medal
a soldier gets a rupee extra monthly, and a soldier
therefore prizes his medals; but the loyalty medal
given to all the troops by the present Amir, when
after two years they had remained faithful to him,
and had given no trouble, was in many cases pawned
for the value of its silver in order to buy food,
for the famine came on shortly after the medals
were distributed. During the famine, when flour
was unobtainable, the Government gave wheat in
lieu of a certain portion of the soldiers’ pay, and
continued to do so until supplies from the new
crops came in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span></p>

<p>The length of a soldier’s service is indefinite, and
may be regarded as continuing until he is too old for
his duties. Many of the soldiers have told me that
they had not seen their families for over twenty
years, for there are no recognized regulations regarding
leave, and when it is absolutely necessary for a
soldier to go to his home to settle some private
affairs, he is allowed to do so provided he leaves a
substitute behind him. In some cases the substitutes
are quite young boys, and I have seen several of
them in the Jidrani and other regiments of hillmen
who were so small that the rifle they carried seemed
huge in comparison; but usually they were smart in
carrying out their duties, and were quick in attending
to orders. What their value would be on active
service is another matter. The soldiers are mostly
poor men, and some of them have nothing but their
pay for themselves and family to depend upon, so
when they find that they are growing old and their
beards and hair getting grey, they dye them, in
order to continue on the active list and go on
drawing pay.</p>

<p>The barracks of the soldiers are unfurnished, that
is, they have no beds, chairs, or tables, and the men
sleep on the floor, excepting those who are fortunate
enough to possess a charpai, or wooden bedstead, and
for a dining-table they spread a coarse mat on the
ground and sit on it while eating their food. Each
paira (guard of seven men, including the havildar)
carries its own cooking utensils, and it is the havildar’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
duty to provide a chopper for cutting firewood and
an iron plate on which to bake bread; the other
utensils, which consist of a copper cooking-pot, a
metal teapot, which is also used as a kettle, and
handleless teacups, are provided by the men. As it
is their custom to eat with their fingers direct from
the pot, no knives and forks or plates are required.</p>

<p>When off duty they laze about in groups, or sit
and listen while one of their number strums the
rubarb and sings, or else they tell stories. Many
of the soldiers are inveterate gamblers, and although
card-playing is strictly forbidden and severely punished
when detected, it is very common among them, and
leads to a good deal of crime, and I knew one man
who shot himself because of his losses at cards. If
their quarters are near a bazar, they stroll about there,
and very often make themselves objectionable to the
people, and generally show off as soldiers will when
they have nothing better to do. The soldiers, however,
do not have a great deal of time to themselves,
for there are many guards which they have to mount
and other duties on which they are kept busy. Their
duties on guard are not tiring, and they do little but
sit and sleep, except when they have to take their
turn at sentry-go. They have passwords for the
night, and the word is changed every second or third
night. With those on guard round the Amir the
password is different each night, and is strictly
enforced.</p>

<p>The various regiments are usually named after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
the tribe or country they come from, such as the
Mohmundai, Jidrani, Jarji, Kandahari, Kohistani,
Ardeel, ʾOud Khel. Then there are the sappers and
miners, which regiment is entirely composed of
Hazaras, and the artillery, which is called the toop
khana. All the men of the army are Afghans, excepting
the sappers and miners and the Kotwali
(police) regiment, the latter being derisively styled
by other regiments as “panch padar” (men with five
fathers). The Amir’s horse-guards are called the
“Rissala Shahi.”</p>

<p>The ʾOud Khels are the thief tribe, and as it was
impossible to stop their depredations by other means,
for the chiefs of the tribe said their land was unproductive
and they had no other means of living, the
late Amir formed the bulk of them into a regiment,
and gave the rest of the tribe to understand that
they must stop stealing from their fellow-countrymen,
telling them that if they wanted to steal they must
go to India to do it. Many of the rifles stolen from
Peshawur and other Indian cantonments could be
accounted for by these people. The ʾOud Khels used
to give the former Amirs of the country a good deal
of trouble, and they resisted the various feeble
attempts made at different times to keep them in
order; but Amir Abdur Rahman was too strong for
them, as he was for most of the lawless people of the
country.</p>

<p>There is a story told by the people of Kabul of
Amir Shere Ali and the chief of the ʾOud Khels.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
The latter had been sent for to be told that unless the
tribe stopped their thieving, which had of late been
very flagrant, the Amir would have each robber
caught and hanged. The chief told him that no one
could catch an ʾOud Khel in the exercise of his profession,
for they were all past masters, and in proof
of what he said he undertook to rob the sleeping
shawl from under the Amir himself that night, and
consented to being hanged if he was caught while
doing so. The next morning the chief appeared
before the Amir and produced the sleeping shawl
from under his coat, handed it to him, saying that he
had redeemed his word. The Amir was astounded
that the man could pass his guards, make his way
undetected into his sleeping chamber, and there take
from under him the shawl he slept on, without
waking him; and from that time, it was said, Amir
Shere Ali left the ʾOud Khels alone.</p>

<p>The ʾOud Khel regiment used to take their turn
of guard in the workshops, each regiment in turn
supplies a company for a month on this duty, and
their captain I found to be a simple-minded man,
and having helped some of his men during the first
cholera epidemic that occurred while I was there, we
became acquainted. He used to come to my office
at times during the dinner-hour and chat with me,
and one day I asked him to teach me the Pushtoo
language, as I wished to learn it and had no book
to study it from. He seemed uncomfortable when I
asked him and remained silent, but after a time he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
said he could not teach languages, because he was not
accustomed to it, but he would teach me to thieve,
and he undertook to make me so efficient that in a
few weeks no one would be able to catch me doing it.
The ʾOud Khel regiment was disbanded by the Amir
at one time, but they at once took to their old profession,
and complaints were so loud that the Amir
had them enrolled again.</p>

<p>The titles of the officers of the army are, Super
Salah or Commander-in-Chief, Naib Salah, his deputy,
Jinrael (general), Kernael (colonel), Kameedand (commandant),
Kaftan (captain), Subadar (lieutenant of
foot), Risaldar (lieutenant of horse), Havildar (sergeant
of foot), Duffedar (sergeant of horse). The
chief officers of the army are selected from the Amir’s
family, or from among his favourites, and there is no
promotion by grades, but only by favouritism. The
late Amir, when forming a regiment, would have the
men drawn up in front of him, and then, by simply
judging the character of those he thought suitable,
would select from among them those who were to be
the officers.</p>

<p>There are several bands, some with string and
some with wind instruments, and the music the brass
bands bring forth is something to be remembered,
for all the instruments seem to keep their own time,
and each man apparently plays a tune of his own,
and does his best to make what he plays over heard
above the others. The result is rather staggering
when they are close to one. There is a bagpipe band,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
too, and snatches of their music would make it
appear that they try to play Scotch airs; and the
men of this band imitate the Highland dress, the
skirt being represented by a check print shirt, which
hangs below the tunic and outside the trousers,
which latter are often dirty white calico ones. This
band is a tribute to the fighting qualities of the
Highlanders, whom the Afghans look upon as
superior to all others, and say they are real
devils.</p>

<p>I was told by one man that during the fighting
on the Sher Darwaza heights by the city of Kabul,
one day the English had to retire, and he saw among
the last to go one of the Highlanders running
leisurely back carrying his rifle under his arm, with
the muzzle pointing behind, and, as he ran, slipping
cartridges into the breach, and firing back at the
enemy. The man said he could see that the Highlander’s
heart was not in his running away. On
this day’s fighting many of the citizens turned out
to take part in it, and the man who told me the
foregoing was one of them.</p>

<p>The Afghans appear to judge music by the
volume of sound created, for on one of the festivals,
when I went with some others to salaam the Queen-Sultana,
we were entertained in an open pavilion in
the garden, and three bands were sent to play to
us. They did so, stationing themselves on three
sides of the pavilion and loudly playing different
things at once, and it was rather trying, for they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
don’t get tired soon, but the people round about
seemed to think it quite all right.</p>

<p>The Afghan Army, regarded as a fighting
machine matched against civilized troops, could not
be considered efficient. The Afghan, as a soldier,
has many good qualities; he can live for days on
a few handfuls of grain, and endure considerable
fatigue at the same time; he can sleep in the open
on the coldest night, wrapped in his sheepskin, and
do no more than he is accustomed to; over mountains
he is untiring; and he is plucky and would fight
well, provided he had confidence in his officers. He
also appreciates pluck, and Lieutenant Hamilton,
who was with Cavagnari, and was one of those
massacred, is to this day spoken of as the brave
Feringhee. His own officers, however, are no better
than himself in their knowledge of the art of war,
and being chosen mostly from among the men, they
have little authority as officers, and the influence of
those who are looked up to by the men is entirely
due to their own individuality. There is very little
discipline, and unless an officer exerts his personality
to make the men carry out his orders, he will find
that they take very little notice of them, or him; for
the soldiers are quick to judge who is their master,
and leniency or consideration is looked upon by them
as one of two things—fear of themselves, or the act
of a fool.</p>

<p>None of the generals have any knowledge of
modern warfare, for their experience has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
confined to the wild tribes of those countries brought
under the rule of the Afghans of late years, and of
those who fought against the English during the
last war there are few, if any, living. When they
talk of fighting any foreign power, they rely on the
number of soldiers and hillmen that the preaching
of the Jihad will influence to fight for their country;
and another thing they look upon as advantageous
to themselves is that the country is so broken
up and mountainous, it would offer considerable
difficulty to the effective and rapid movement of
invading troops, and it is this which forms one of the
Amir’s chief objections to the introduction of railways
in his country. The Afghans rarely care to risk a
pitched battle, and are besides more accustomed to
guerilla warfare, and in the event of invasion it is
the latter method of fighting which would, no doubt,
be adopted, and among the mountain passes there
are places where a few determined men, properly
armed, could keep back an army. For an invading
army there would be great difficulty in getting
heavy artillery moved about in most parts of the
country, and mule batteries would be required;
but in the plains around Kabul, Jelalabad, and
Kandahar, big guns would be wanted, at least
equal in range to the Afghan guns, and to get
these to the Kabul plains, except by two roundabout
routes, would be very difficult.</p>

<p>The Afghan authorities have now more confidence
in the efficiency of their army, and consider<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
it quite different and superior to what it was when
Lord Roberts was there, and it is possible, in the
event of another war with them, that they would
offer battle in force, but if the day went against
them, the rest of the fighting would probably be of
the guerilla sort, to which they are more accustomed,
unless they considerably outnumbered the enemy at
any time. In their own fighting, one against the
other, there is generally one pitched battle, and whosoever
is routed runs away and fights no more; they
say themselves, that a defeated army runs, and does
not stop running, under three days.</p>

<p>In time of war women carry supplies to the men,
and then the laws of “purdah” are suspended, and
being a case of necessity, they are allowed to show
their faces without shame. It is well known that the
women, during the wars with the English, used to go
out at night after a battle, and mutilate the bodies
of the dead, and kill the wounded and dying. Many
also took part in the fighting. As an illustration of
one side of the Afghan character, I may mention an
incident told me by a man, who belonged to the
Kandahar district. His cousin owned a house some
miles out of Kandahar (I have mentioned that houses
are protected by high walls), and after one of the
battles fought by the English against the tribes about,
there were many stragglers following the main army
back towards Kandahar. One day his cousin was
told by one of his men that an Englishman was outside
the walls shouting, and on going to the roof,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
whence he could look over the wall, he saw a
Highlander carrying a rifle, who called out to give
him some food. The cousin ran back to his room,
and brought out a rifle, and climbing up to the roof
again, knelt behind the wall, and aiming carefully at
the soldier, fired. The man dropped, but was not
killed, as a movement could now and then be
observed, and the cousin feared to go out to get the
rifle, for which he had shot him; so they kept watch
for two days before it was decided that life must be
extinct, and during that time the soldier called often
and piteously for water, but no one went near,
fearing vengeance as long as there was life left
in him.</p>

</div>

<p>Amir Abdur Rahman was greatly interested in all
mechanical work, and his interest extended to trade,
and the merchants carrying it on. The status of a
merchant, in his opinion, was equal to that of any of
his Government officials, and any complaint or
representation a merchant might make to him was sure
of a hearing. When he started his workshops, his
avowed intention in doing so was not only to be able
to turn out guns and rifles, but to educate his people.
He said he wanted to teach them the trades of other
countries, in order that they might raise themselves
to a level with the people of other nations,
whereby they would not only make themselves and
their country as prosperous as others were, but also
by having an interest in work, would lose their habits
of idleness, which caused them to drift into lawlessness
and wrong-doing. He afterwards complained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
many times that, in spite of all he had done for
them, his people were still the same, and that
although he had killed so many thousands, the lesson
failed to have the effect he desired on the rest of his
subjects.</p>

<p>His son, the present Amir, also takes the keenest
interest in all things mechanical, and having been,
from the time he was a boy, the chief officer of the
Government workshops, visiting them once a week,
and inspecting each department and all that was
turned out, his knowledge of machinery is greater
than that possessed by his father. There are some
matters, however, that the Amir and the officials
connected with the workshops cannot properly grasp,
and occasions them a good deal of thought and
perplexity. For instance, they cannot quite understand
that it requires a given quantity of heat to
generate a given quantity of steam, and as they burn
a large amount of wood daily in the boilers (they
have no coal), they are ever trying to reduce this
quantity, without lessening the work of the engines.
Once they thought they had solved the question,
by using larger and thicker pieces of wood for the
boilers, because these burnt more slowly than small
pieces, and then when these huge lumps of wood
failed to keep up the head of steam, and the engines
ran slower and slower, they suspected the firemen
of being the cause of it, and so had several of them
thrashed.</p>

<p>Another time the stock of firewood for the boilers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
ran out, and a supply of freshly cut wood was brought
in daily, for use until further large supplies could be
arranged for, and stocked to dry. The wood being
wet, it naturally burned slowly, and the steam could
not be kept up, and although the daily consumption
of wood remained the same, the engines worked
worse than ever. They tried many things to alter
this state of affairs, and looked in all directions but
the right one to find the cause of the engines not
working well, even opening out the cylinders to see
if the pistons were right, and when all their investigations
failed to locate the cause of the trouble, the
firemen were thrashed again. The firemen were once
convicted of falsifying the quantity of wood burnt
daily, making out that a larger quantity was used
than was correct, and selling the balance, and after
that they were ever suspected of doing their work
badly or trying to spoil things for revenge. This
was principally the reason that, whenever one of the
officials got a bright idea for reducing the quantity
of wood burnt daily, the firemen were invariably
accused of spoiling the experiment, and as often as
not were punished on suspicion. The life of a man
who works on that which is little understood by
those over him is not all roses.</p>

<p>Although I was nominally in charge of the boilers
and engines, with all sorts of other work, I was not
responsible for the quantities of materials used, that
being in the hands of another official, and the
inherent suspicious nature of the Afghan, together<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
with his ignorance of work, makes him chary of
accepting advice on such matters, so that, although
I was consulted, my opinion, which exonerated the
firemen, was looked upon as prejudiced, and my
proposal to cut the wood into small pieces was
regarded as a desire to waste Government property.
Soon after my appointment as engineer to the Government,
I had received another firman (Amir’s written
order) which placed the engines and boilers in my
charge in addition to the work for which I had been
engaged, and I was told to thoroughly examine them,
as the engines worked very badly, and to report if it
was the fault of the engines, boilers, or the firemen.
No firman is given without all people whom it
concerns knowing it very soon after, and when I
went to the boiler-house the next day, I found the
men there very gloomy, and they probably thought
that, as they who were on the work always and had
done their best to keep steam up on the limit of
firewood had failed, there was little chance of my
doing better, and then, no doubt, I would put the
blame on them, according to the method of their own
people, who always blame the men under them when
they are unable to right matters. My examination
of the boilers showed that they were encrusted with
a thick deposit of lime and mud, for no attempt had
been made to clean them out since they were first
started, so the men told me, and it took about two
weeks to put matters right. After this the firemen
always referred to me as an authority when blamed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
for their work, and it was considered that I had
found out their swindling and had promised not to
report them if they carried on the work properly in
future. In many other things I found that it was
thought I favoured the workmen, and shielded them
from punishment because I pitied them, for I let it
be known very clearly that I considered the pay of
most of the men inadequate, and though I was able
to have the wages of many of the men increased as
opportunity offered, it was done more as a favour to
me than anything else, and other workmen remained
at the same rate of pay on which they started work.</p>

</figure>

<p>Another idea they had was that of bringing
water to a higher level by means of syphons, and
one day, when I was in durbar with the late Amir,
he held forth on this subject to some chiefs who
had come to see him from a distant part of the
country, explaining to them, that if you take an
inverted syphon, and pour water down one of its legs,
the water rises up out of the other one; it did not
rise up far above the level of the second opening, he
said, but he intended using a series of them to
bring water in this way to a dry stretch of land
near Kabul, which stood above the level of the neighbouring
streams, and he turned and asked me, if what
he said was not correct. I gave no answer, as an
affirmative would involve me in the carrying out of
the work, and to say otherwise would not be polite
in public durbar, when it was the Amir who spoke.
Some time afterwards the principal ustads (foremen)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
of the workshops were sent for by the Amir, who
explained his idea to them, and told them to think it
over and see who could do this work, either by such
syphons or a pump that would work by itself. They
retired and gave several days to the consideration of
the problem, and making various experiments, and I
heard of the matter by their eventually coming to me
in ones and twos, to ask my opinion and advice.</p>

<p>In the iron and brass foundries, I found that the
quantity of fuel allowed for drying moulds and cores
was so small that almost half of the castings turned
out bad. This was another case of saving money for
the Government by the official in charge, whose pay
had been increased for so doing, as a well-wisher of
the Government. The great percentage of bad castings
caused thereby was an item of loss not considered
until I pointed it out.</p>

<p>The Afghan officials who manage shops or works
of any description very much resemble the travelling
M.P. who spends three or four months in India in the
cold season, and then goes home prepared to explain
the cause of, and a remedy for, all problems connected
with its governing.</p>

<p>The Kabul workshops comprise two large machine-shops,
with about a hundred machines of sorts; two
cartridge-making shops with machinery for turning
out solid drawn Martini and Snider cartridges; metal
fuze shop, blacksmiths’ shops, steam hammer shop,
iron and brass foundries, mint, rolling-mill shop,
and the boiler and engine houses. There are besides<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
these, hand shops for making limbers and wheels of
guns, gun cartridges, cartridge and shell filling,
artillery harness, bandoliers, boots, etc., gun browning,
black powder, percussion cap powder, leather tanning
and currying, soap and candle, spirit distilling, acid
making, electro-plating and polishing, sword and
bayonet making and grinding, bullet moulding, tin
and copper work, carpentry, pattern making, painting,
household furniture making, etc. Between four
and five thousand men are employed.</p>

<p>The Afghan workman is intelligent, and can, if
he will only give his mind to his work, or domestic
or other affairs will allow him to do so, do work
requiring considerable skill and intelligence in a
manner which is highly creditable. This is the
Afghan workman at his best. In the case of work
requiring very exact fitting or finish, they generally
fail, mostly because they have not thoroughly
mastered the art of making gauges and working to
them, and it is chiefly on this account that the field
and machine guns are unreliable. In some cases a
workman appears to have displayed a considerable
amount of ingenuity in ascertaining the wrong way
to do a thing and then so doing it; but there is,
however, no doubt, that with education and training
the Afghan would make a fine workman. I have
often known a man ruin his work, otherwise well
finished, through lack of technical knowledge of
some process in one part of it, and I was generally
applied to for help after the failure, for they all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
like to do things off their own bat, if they can,
hoping, thereby, to get all the credit from the
Amir. Much of the reason for their not applying
to any one for help is the fault of the officials, who,
when bringing a man with some special work he
has done before the Amir, claim that the man was
at a standstill in this or that way during its process,
and that they assisted him in his difficulty, thus
cheapening the work of the man’s hands to their
own credit, and in some cases the official claims the
entire credit, making out that the man worked to
instructions. However, it is one of the results of
the system of government that all men try to bring
themselves to the Amir’s favourable notice, and the
means are of little account for so desirable an end.</p>

<p>In all work there is an ustad (teacher or foreman)
and his shagirds (pupils or workmen). When
the shagird has learnt all he can learn from his
ustad, or thinks he has, he usually casts about for
a way of ousting his master and taking his place
himself. This he generally sets about doing by
privately reporting to the Amir that his ustad
indents for much more material than his work requires,
and sells the surplus to help defray his living
expenses, which, as all his neighbours will testify,
are far above his income. This does not always
have the effect aimed at, and cause the ustad to
lose his position that the shagird may jump into
it; but the ustad is perhaps made a prisoner, and
wears leg irons as he goes about his work as usual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
during the day, and at night is taken back to
prison, while the mirzas set about the task of checking
his accounts, and as this is a work of years,
the ustad often dies before the matter is settled.</p>

<p>In any work which is accompanied by risk, such
as powder making, etc., the Afghan gets careless of
precautions after a time, and the result is an occasional
explosion, which kills many and unnerves
the rest for a month or two, but eventually the
same carelessness prevails, until another accident
makes them cautious again for a time. The making
of fulminate of mercury was prolific of accidents at
one time, but no further accidents happened after I
introduced the usual method of preparation, but
some accidents occurred through roughly handling
the filled percussions caps, and once sixty thousand
of them exploded through carelessness on the part
of one of the foremen, who took up a few of them
to look at, and then threw them back into the box
where the rest were; four were killed, and some
others were permanently disabled, while one man
was blinded, a cap entering each eye, but was otherwise
uninjured. In one powder explosion twenty-one
men were killed, and many others injured, chiefly
through the force of the explosion bringing down
a heavy roof on the men who were working underneath.
There were several other accidents through
carelessness, each time causing death or injury to
one or two, and eventually the Amir gave me
orders to draw up a list of regulations, and give<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
full particulars of what was necessary, in order to
minimize risk in the making and handling of explosives.
Having sanctioned this, the necessary
work was put in hand, and the regulations came
into force, after which the accidents stopped.</p>

<p>The pay of the workman is mostly fixed at
starvation rates, though several of the men, who
have had their pay increased for doing some small
work for the Amir himself, get too much so far as
ability is concerned. The workshops were started
about eighteen years ago, and the pay of many of
the workmen, who were boys when they were first
engaged, is still the same, although they have become
of greater value to the Government by the
experience they have gained, and that which makes
it still harder for them is that the price of food
has increased tremendously, and bread, which is
their chief food, is four times the price now to what
it was then. There are men who have been working
on special machines from the time the shops
started, drawing eight rupees per month (5<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>),
and these are men with wives and families, and
sometimes other female relatives dependent on them.
How they live on it is a problem, but they are
men with no surplus adipose substance on their
bones, as may be imagined. Others, and they are
mostly boys, who are taken on now for any new
work, commence at ten rupees (6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>) per month.
Most of the ordinary machine men (turners, etc.),
and hand-fitters, get from twenty to thirty rupees<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
per month (13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> to 20<i>s.</i>). Ustads get from
twenty to one hundred rupees per month (13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>
to 66<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>).</p>

<p>Excepting in the Government workshops there
are very few trades carried on in the country. The
few trades there are, and they are all carried on in
a small way only, are coppersmiths, tinsmiths, blacksmiths,
gold and silversmiths, carpenters, leather
workers, etc. The bulk of the commerce of the
country is confined to dried fruits, which are exported
to India and Russia. Fresh grapes are also
sent to India, wrapped in wool, and enclosed in
small round wooden boxes. Kabul and its neighbourhood
produce large quantities of very good
grapes, which sell in the season at about a penny
for eight pounds, and for the best varieties at about
a farthing per pound. I made wine from these
grapes, blending two or three sorts; and after
maturing for three years or so, it was equal to any
of the wines commonly sold in India, and being
pure grape juice, it was perhaps better than most.
Apricots are also grown in large quantities, and
grapes and apricots form the bulk of the dried fruits
exported. Grain is also exported, though not in
large quantities; but, with cheap means of carriage,
a large trade in several articles could be brought
about. Most fruits and vegetables grow well in
Kabul, and large crops are given, the climate being
particularly adapted for all fruits not requiring a
tropical sun. In Jelalabad and Kandahar districts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
the heat is such that most tropical fruits are grown,
and in the former district sugar-cane is produced in
large quantities.</p>

<p>A good deal of silk is also produced, and the
country offers great facilities for an extensive cultivation
of the silkworm. The silk is at present produced
in three districts—Bokhara, Herat, and
Kohistan, and there only in comparatively small
quantities. Carpets are also made: those similar
to Persian carpets in Herat and Turkestan, and felt
carpets in Kandahar and Hazara. Cloth of various
descriptions is also manufactured by means of hand-looms
in different parts of the country, and in Ghazni
numbers of posteens (overcoats) are made from sheep
skins. Most of the latter articles are not exported,
for only enough is produced to meet the demands
of the country. Numbers of camels, horses, cattle,
and sheep are bred in different districts, but few
are exported, and for the past few years horses are
not allowed to be taken out of the country for sale,
something having been said about them being bought
up for the use of the Indian army. Turkestan is
the best cattle and horse-raising country in Afghanistan,
as it possesses large tracts of fertile country
for grazing; and to hear Turkestanis talk of the
agricultural and mineral richness of their country,
one would imagine it the Eldorado. A small
quantity of timber is floated down the river from
the Jelalabad district for sale in India, but the
quantity is very small, for the hills and mountains<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
in Afghanistan are for the most part quite barren,
and there are very few trees except in one or two
isolated places, and not many there.</p>

</figure>

<p>There is little or no rainfall in the country, but
in the winter snowstorms are frequent, and the
melting of the snow on the mountains gives the
water required for the crops during spring and
summer, the water being led over the land by means
of channels for the necessary irrigation. These
irrigation channels are cleaned out every spring,
and on the day appointed for clearing the stream,
all the men who use the water are called together
by drum and fife (or an instrument similar to it),
and they work up stream each day in a body,
clearing away weeds, and deepening the channel
where it has silted up until the whole is finished.</p>

<p>There are frequent fights among cultivators about
the first use of the water from the subsidiary channels,
for it frequently happens that the smaller ones
do not carry enough water to irrigate the land on
both sides at once, and naturally quarrels ensue as
to who shall have the water first. Long handled
spades are generally in the hands of those who are
quarrelling, and these are used, and men are killed
at times, for the spade inflicts a heavy blow and
cuts deeply. The quarrels also frequently lead to
one man firing the other’s crops in revenge, and
then lawsuits, with numbers of paid witnesses on
both sides, result.</p>

<p>The mills for grinding flour are fixed at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
convenient points on the irrigation streams, and are
worked by water-wheels, which, however, have a
very low efficiency, less than a quarter of the power
available being transmitted to the mill. The mills
are of a very old type; one stone revolves on a
fixed lower one, and the grain is fed in at a hole
pierced near the centre of the upper stone. The
flour from the first grinding is very coarse, and it
is reground two or more times, according to the
degree of fineness required.</p>

<p>There is a great want in Afghanistan of some
cheap and speedy means of carrying freight. At
present the cumbersome method of carrying all things
by pack-animals is the only means at disposal, and
the time occupied in getting over a short distance
necessarily makes the system a costly one, for it
takes a week for them to travel a hundred miles, and
the cost of doing so works out at about eighteen
shillings a hundred-weight for that distance, and this
in a country where all things are cheap. The weight
and size of any article carried is also limited to the
carrying capacity of the horse or camel employed.</p>

<p>The Koochee people do most of the carrying of
goods from place to place, and they are a hardy race,
similar to gipsies in having no fixed home. They
move about in caravans of fifty to a hundred animals,
which include camels, horses, donkeys, and sheep, for
sheep have to carry small packs too. The women
and children travel with the caravan wherever it
goes, and the household pots and pans, with a few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
fowl, are carried on the top of a donkey, the fowl,
with their feet tied to prevent escape, sitting on the
top of the pack, and the baby, if there is one,
wrapped in a shawl, and carried in a bundle beside
them. They often have a large number of sheep
with them, and when the lambs are too young to
stand the journey the boys and girls carry them in
their arms. When they stop for a while at any
place they rig up rough huts, composed of sticks
covered with mats or grass, but at other times the
shelter of a tree or rock suffices. They are a finely
built people, with free, graceful movements, due, no
doubt, to the open-air life they lead and the constant
exercise, and as no sickly child could live such a life,
it is a case of the survival of the fittest.</p>

<p>One such caravan passed me one day while I was
standing near a road I was constructing through a
ravine, and the reports from some blasting going on
near by made one of the young camels bolt. In
doing so he collided with a full-grown girl of the
caravan, and she was thrown some distance, landing
with a good deal of force on some sharp jutting
boulders and stones. I started forward, thinking
she must be killed; but the girl, after a few
moments, sprang up, brushed the dust from her
clothes, and walked on unconcernedly. The Koochee
women are not purdah, though they cover their faces
with a shawl as they pass an Englishman. During
the harvest months, when the heat of the lowland
plains is too great for the pack-animals, and there is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
little carrying work done, the Koochee people move
from one place to another, working as harvesters,
and when the crops of one district are cut and in, they
go on to another; for owing to differences in altitude
the harvesting time in different districts varies. The
men who look after the camels fasten them at night-time
in a circle, so that the camels, in a way, form a
wheel, with bodies as spokes, and noses pointing to
the hub. The man, when he sleeps, lies down in the
centre under the necks of the camels, and rests there
unmolested by them.</p>

<p>Tea is imported into the country through India.
Generally speaking, the Chinese green tea only is
consumed, and it is shipped from China to Bombay,
and thence railed up to Peshawar for the Kabul
merchants, and to Quetta for the Kandahar and
Herat merchants. From Peshawar to Kabul, and
from Quetta to Kandahar it is carried on by camels.
A large quantity of tea is imported annually, and
only the very poor use the Indian hill tea, as they
cannot afford the other, which sells at three shillings
to five shillings a pound. I once tried to introduce
an Indian green tea into Kabul; but they did not
care for its flavour, and the fact of it being Indian
tea was sufficient to condemn it in their opinion.</p>

<p>Other articles imported are cotton goods, cloth,
silks, and velvets. Of the latter two, large quantities
are used by the women, and at one time men and
boys dressed a good deal in silks and velvets also;
but the new court fashion is black cloth, so the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
demand for them is getting less with the men.
Saddlery and leather goods, old clothes, sugar, and
other household necessaries, are brought up by
merchants from India; but the trade in them is
very small.</p>

<p>There are no measures in Kabul for grain, liquids,
etc., and all things are sold by weight. The weights
differ from those used in India, and are built up
from the nukhut, a description of pulse about the
size of a pea, the weight of each seed of which is
fairly equal. Twenty-four of these nukhuts go to
a miskal (six and one-sixth miskals nearly equal
an ounce); ninety-six miskals equal one pau, which
is slightly less than an English pound; sixteen pau
equal one seer, and eighty seers equal one kharwar.
Excepting in the Government stores there are no
exact weights made and used; the people in the
bazar taking stones of different sizes and using them
as weights, the difference between the stone and the
true weight being on the side of the shopkeeper of
course. In lineal measure there are two different
yards, or guz, as they are called. The one used by
surveyors and builders is nearly twenty-eight inches,
and the other guz for measuring cloth, etc., is nearly
forty-two inches. The kro, or mile, is, as I have
already mentioned, an indefinite quantity, but is
usually taken to be about one and a half English
miles.</p>

<p>The Government offices are controlled and worked
by the mirzas, or clerks. The mirza is looked upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
as an educated man in the country, but his education
is limited to Persian literature, a smattering of the
old Arabic, and the first four rules of arithmetic;
but even in these first four rules he is far from
proficient, and when it comes to a fraction being
included in the calculation, he is hopelessly lost.
I was present once when some eight or ten of them
together tried to solve a calculation which involved
multiplication only, and all of them arrived at
different results, while the man who was nearest
the correct answer took a good deal of credit to
himself for being so nearly right. The mirzas are
a class of themselves, although drawn from all
classes, and they differ from the rest of the population
in their nervous and soft manner, at the back
of which, however, is a nature as cruel and heartless
as any in the country. It is not the cleverest
mirza in his work who comes to the front and
has charge of departments, but the one who is
cleverest in deceit and intrigue, and it is to excellence
in these respects that the young mirza gives
attention, when he listens to his elders making up
a case, with words and meaning purposely involved,
to give them a loophole of escape should their
scheme fall through. The mirzas are full of cunning,
and difficult for the layman to trap, and they are
ever scheming one against the other, or against
other people who have money, that they may in
one way or another get them in their coils and
squeeze them (as they put it).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span></p>

<p>The work they prize most is taking the accounts
of one of themselves, or of some official whom they
have already reported to the Amir, as swindling the
Government of lakhs of rupees, and undertaking in
their report to prove what they say. After reporting
such a case, they are generally given the task of
proving their accusation, and this necessitates the
accused person’s accounts being gone through. In
doing this they are weighed by no consideration of
the figures shown in the books and papers under
examination, but search their minds for an idea of
some allegation which will involve the accused and be
difficult for him to refute, and then, for proof of lesser
wrong-doing which will give colour to the greater
alleged wrong, they look through the papers, and, as
no official is guileless in the conduct of his duties, it
is usually easy to get up a few bad-looking cases
against him. Then they go into figures, and I have
known men accused of swindling more than double
the amount which has actually passed through their
hands; and to do this without being detected is
simpler than it appears, for very few persons besides
the mirzas can do more than count up to twenty,
and the mirza’s papers give the figures and other
proofs of the huge sums swindled. Then all of them
go before the Amir, together with the papers and
other proofs (?), and in the end the accused is put in
prison together with his family, and all his money
and other property is confiscated. To be correct, not
all is confiscated, for a good deal of money has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
already gone into the investigating mirza’s hands in
a vain attempt to induce him to withdraw his charge,
or at least reduce his figures; but although the mirza
will hold out hopes until he gets the money, he
knows that, having begun, he must ruin the man
and have him put where he is harmless, or else there
will be an ever active enemy lying in wait for him.
However, there is always requital, for no one mirza
holds any position for long, and a day comes when the
intriguer is himself treated in the same way, and is
put in prison or killed. Two or three years is the
usual limit of a mirza’s tenure of high office, for
their methods of attracting money to themselves soon
lead to exposure by other mirzas who become envious
and want the position themselves, in order that they,
too, may make something, and have a merry, if a
short, life.</p>

<p>In getting up cases, the mirzas do as others do,
and pay false witnesses, and this leads at times to
the Amir being at a loss to know which side is right,
and ordering them all to be tortured with the fanah
in order to find out the truth. I saw two mirzas,
who were accused of falsifying accounts, being publicly
fanah’d in the bazar one day as I rode through;
but they were making statements very rapidly with
the minimum of pressure on the fanah. Their endurance
is less than that of the other men of the country,
and this is no doubt due to a sedentary life and incessant
smoking, for wherever you see a mirza, there,
too, you will see a chillum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span></p>

<p>The mirzas have various ways of making money,
and one is in the collection of customs duties and
various taxes, when they make all they can out of
the people who have to pay. If they have to give
a receipt to any man for money paid, or goods
delivered, they will keep the man waiting all day
for it, or even for a few days, if he gives them
nothing. The equivalent of a penny is accepted if
the man is poor and they see he can give no
more. Men coming into Kabul and having to travel
two or three days to get there to pay some duty or
tax of less than a rupee, have been kept waiting for
days because they refused to give the mirza a few
annas; so the people see that it saves money to give
to the mirzas, and if they complain to a higher
authority the mirza and all in his office will swear
that the man never came near them. Again, if
money has to be paid to a man from the Government
treasury he must give some of it to the mirza who
pays it out, and this is taken so much for granted
that the mirza usually hands it over one or more
rupees short, according to the amount of money that
has to be paid.</p>

<p>The late Amir used to give salaries to very few of
the mirzas employed on Government work. He said
they made money from the people whether they got
a salary or not, and as the people would not complain
to him, they might pay for the mirzas—an
economical way of looking at the matter. The
Government storekeepers are all mirzas, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
apparently make a good thing out of it, for they wear
good clothes, ride good horses, and have many wives
and women in their houses, though their pay is seldom
more than the equivalent of ten pounds a year.
However, as there is no system of stock-taking, and
no ones knows what is, or is not, in the stores, it is
an easy matter for them to make money out of such
a job, but their tenure of office is usually a short one,
some one or other of those under them reporting
their shortcomings, probably because they were given
too small a share of the plunder.</p>

<p>If an Afghan owes money, it is similar to getting
blood out of a stone to make him pay it; usually the
odds in both cases are equal, unless a considerable
amount of pressure can be applied. With many of
them it looks as though their hearts were wrung
when having to pay up, for it is done with a gloomy
countenance and a display of considerable temper, as
though they were being robbed by force of hard-earned
gains. The method the late Amir inaugurated
for the payment of debts was to send soldiers to
the house of the debtor for the money, and if it was
not at once forthcoming, the soldiers quartered themselves
on the man, and partook of the best in the
house, and if there was no best in the house,
the man was made to get it as quickly as possible,
or feel the weight of the butt end of a rifle.
Under these circumstances the debtor lost no time in
settling up, if only for the sake of getting rid of his
unwelcomed guests, who turned the house upside<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
down, and involved him in the loss of several rupees
each day for their food and tobacco. Any person
proving a debt could apply to Government for these
soldiers, or mahsuls as they are called, and the
soldiers employed for the purpose became quite
experienced in turning these visits to their own
advantage.</p>

<p>There is a colony of Hindoos in Kabul which has
been there for many generations. They are the
money-lenders to the people, as the Jews used to
be in other countries. Also they do almost all the
dealing in precious stones and jewellery, and of late
years most families have been forced to sell much of
the jewellery they possessed, the increased cost of
living necessitating it, in order that they should not
starve. Whatever a Hindoo offers for an article may
be looked upon as being never more than two-thirds
of its value, and the people, among themselves, when
selling anything to one another, say that the Hindoos
offer to give so much for it, and therefore it must be
worth the money they themselves ask. Some of the
Hindoos are employed in the Treasury offices as being
more trustworthy than the mirzas, and also better
accountants.</p>

<p>The money of the country is all coined in Kabul,
the mint, with its up-to-date coining presses, being
situated in the workshops, where the presses are at
times kept working day and night when large sums
of money are required quickly. When the late Amir,
who wanted money badly, saw the revenues yearly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
dwindling, he cast about for means to increase it,
and one day the idea of doing so in the following
way occurred to him. The Kabul rupee used to be
an irregularly shaped coin, hand-stamped, but it was
made of pure silver, so the Amir had all these rupees
collected and melted down as they accumulated, and
as they were melted down a fairly high percentage of
copper was added. This alloyed silver was then cast
into bars, rolled, and coined afresh in the new mint,
which turns out a rupee with a milled edge and
pressed with nicely engraved dies. In this way, by
melting down the old pure silver rupees and adding
copper before re-coining, the Amir made a considerable
amount of profit, and when the old rupees of his
own country were finished, he collected Persian rupees
and added copper to those; but, unfortunately, under
one of the Shahs, the same thing had already been
done, so that many of the Afghan rupees contain
more than double the proportion of copper than is
usual in the standard coinage of other countries.
Thereafter the Amir ordered the collection of those
Persian rupees which were coined under other Shahs,
and the exchange offered for these rupees in the
Kabul treasury was one Persian for one Kabuli rupee;
but to make still further profit, the Amir ordered
that one pice less than a Kabuli rupee should be
given in exchange for each Persian one, and the
Shah, on hearing this, ordered a like reduction in
exchange on all Afghan money brought into his
country. The result of adding an unusual amount of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
copper to the rupee, together with other causes, however,
depreciated its value in India, where five Kabuli
rupees used to be taken in exchange for four Indian,
and the exchange nowadays is two Kabuli for one
Indian.</p>

</div>

<p>It is probable that the Valley of Kabul is the crater
of an ancient volcano, for, in addition to other
indications, there are in many places in the surrounding
hills traces of volcanic action to be seen in the
way of lava cones. At many places, also, are large
beds of mingled lava and small stones, which have
the appearance of extensive concrete blocks, and they
might readily be mistaken for them. Several of these
beds are many hundred yards in length and breadth,
and they mostly lie at the foot of a hill, where they
look like the foundations of a large fort or palace,
from which the superstructure has crumbled and disappeared,
and the rain of centuries has washed away
the surrounding earth and left only the concrete beds
to mark the spot where they stood. It seems likely
that the molten lava flowing down the adjoining hillside
picked up small stones in its progress, and on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
reaching the level ground below spread itself out over
the land and cooled down into a solid block.</p>

<p>The strata of the ground surrounding Kabul is
in a very disturbed condition, some of the hills and
mountains about showing the strata standing perpendicularly,
as though the earth of a flat country
had been lifted bodily and thrown up on end, as, no
doubt, it had been.</p>

<p>Earthquakes are of very common occurrence, and
usually the greater number and those of most violence
occur in October or November. The one which was
worse than all others that I experienced there happened
at the end of December, and as the walls of the Kabul
houses are built of mud bricks, with very heavy roofs
superimposed, many houses were brought down by
the shock, and several people killed through the walls
and roofs falling on them. Preceding this earthquake
a violent storm of wind arose, which broke off large
branches from the trees and threatened to beat the
windows in, and when the wind had been raging for
an hour or so, the earthquake commenced. It came
on about ten o’clock at night, and at the time it commenced
I was standing before one of the windows of
the guest house, which is fortunately solidly built,
and when the shaking and rattling of the windows
began, I thought it was due to the wind, and remarked
to the others in the room that if it continued in
violence the windows would soon be blown in; but
while I was speaking the floor started swinging from
side to side, and then I made a dash for the doorway,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
and stood there until the disturbance ceased. The
doorways are safer than other places in a house
during an earthquake, as, should the roof fall in,
one stands a chance of escaping unhurt. It is difficult
to judge the length of time an earthquake lasts, for
one is more interested in the probabilities attending
it, but it seemed four or five minutes before the
tremors finally ceased, and then I saw that large
cracks had been formed down the walls of the room,
although they are five or six feet thick, and the next
day I heard of different houses completely thrown
down and the people in them killed.</p>

<p>The late Amir, who was ill with gout at the time,
was sitting in durbar, and as soon as the earthquake
commenced, all those with him ran out at once
and left him sitting there, unable to move. With his
constitutional dread of earthquakes, his feelings, when
he found himself deserted, may be imagined; but he
was not left for long, for three or four of the slave-boys
rushed back as soon as the violence began to
subside, and carried him out into the garden. The
shock, however, affected the Amir so much that, as
a thanksgiving for his escape from harm, on the
following day he ordered three to four hundred
prisoners to be released. My Hindustani servants
were asleep in their room when the disturbance
started, and, roused from sleep by the violence of
the shaking, and not knowing the cause, for this was
their first experience of an earthquake, they rushed
out into the open, lightly clad as they were, and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
sinking on their knees in the snow, prayed aloud to
be protected from the calamity that was upon them,
and they were down with fever the next day, the
result of exposure and nervous shock.</p>

<p>In Kohistan, close to Kabul, earthquakes of such
violence occur at times that the mangers for feeding
horses are thrown down. These mangers, which are
built of stone and mud, stand some three feet high only,
and are fairly thick, so that the shaking of the earth
may be imagined when such are overthrown. In
1899 the fortune-tellers prophesied that in the month
which corresponded to November of that year many
earthquakes would be experienced, and the last earthquake
of all would happen on a certain day, which
they specified, and would be of such violence that
all Kabul would be demolished. Strangely enough,
towards the end of that month earthquakes were of
continued occurrence for about two weeks, and not a
day passed without at least one shock being felt, and
on some days there were many, both during the day
and night. Although earthquakes are usual towards
the end of the year, a prolonged continuation was
very exceptional, and the fortune-tellers’ prediction
affected the people to such extent that those who
had tents pitched them on the ground outside the
city walls, and lived in them, for they fully believed
that as the prophecy was in part fulfilled, the rest of
it would come about also, and that it was foolish to
live in a house that was appointed to fall on a certain
day, and in its fall would crush them. The Amir,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
however, who had consulted his own fortune-tellers,
gave orders that any person found living in a tent
outside the city on the day following his proclamation
would be imprisoned, so all of them had
perforce to return to their houses. But, in spite of
the Amir’s assurance, the appointed day for the
overthrowing of Kabul was passed in fear and
trembling by the majority of the people, which was
not allayed by the day commencing with one huge
shock, which made the whole city tremble. However,
no further shocks happened, and that was the
last one felt for several months.</p>

<p>Some of the earthquakes which occurred from
time to time were of the nature of a single bump,
while others were of a rumbling and shaking
character. I have noticed that the latter sort,
which on one or two occasions occurred at night
when all was quiet, and I was lying in bed before
falling asleep, could be heard coming before they
could be felt under the house to make it shake,
and could also be heard pass on, travelling from the
south-west towards the north-east. These earthquakes
resembled a very heavy drag driven along
a bumpy underground road, which, as it passed
immediately underneath, made the house vibrate,
and then could be heard passing on until lost in
the distance.</p>

<p>The subsoil indications show that the valley of
Kabul was at one time a large lake, and that the valley
was not once, but many times submerged, and it is said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
by the people a story has been handed down to
them that where Kabul is now was once a great lake
of many miles in circumference. It is probable that
at the point where the river flows through a cleft in
the mountains which surround Kabul on its way
down to India, landslips occurred at times, which
blocked up the outlet of the river, and caused the
water to rise until all the surrounding country was
submerged, and the water went on rising until it was
so high that the dam caused by the landslip was
unable to hold it back, and then the obstacle would
be swept away, and the valley drained of its water,
and remain dry until another landslip blocked the
river’s progress once again. From the appearance of
the sub-strata when making excavations, I concluded
that there had been many inundations, and the
thicknesses of the different deposits superimposed one
on the other, showed the floods to have lasted for
varying periods of time. On the mountain sides
around Kabul there are also rocks and boulders
which have the appearance of being water-washed,
and in some places the under-part of rocky cliffs are
holed through and worn smooth by the action of
water, similar to cliffs on the seashore, and as
some of these appear at very high levels, it would
lead one to suppose that the Kabul valley was at one
time of much greater extent, and subterranean disturbances
subsequently threw up high some of those
portions of the land which were formerly under
water. The rocks on the Asman Heights, past which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
the river flows, are water-marked and worn up to
some fifty yards above the level of the river, which is
probably the height to which some of the floods rose.</p>

<p>In the mountains near Khurd Kabul, about thirty
miles from Kabul, thin seams of new coal have been
found outcropping. There are several seams deposited
one on the other, and they vary in thickness
from a sixteenth of an inch to eight or nine inches,
and are separated by thin layers of clay, the thicker
seams of coal being lower than the thinner ones.
In some cases three inches in thickness of the strata
show about twelve different deposits of carbonaceous
matter, and point to various short periods of inundation
following in rapid succession.</p>

<p>Throughout Afghanistan the strata are in a most
disturbed condition, and in innumerable places veins
of ore, which are rich in metal, are found outcropping
on the mountain sides. Ores of copper, lead, silver,
zinc, tin, nickel, etc., are numerous. Gold is found
in the sand of several of the northern rivers, and it
is said the river Oxus is rich in it too. Gold-bearing
quartz was found within a couple of miles of Kandahar,
but it has been exhausted. Samples which have
been kept of the gold embedded in a matrix of quartz
show the mine to have been a rich one, and it is said
that large quantities of gold were obtained from it
by former Amirs. Many of the copper ores sent me
to assay were very rich in metal, and samples containing
thirty to forty per cent. of copper were
common, and there were others with about sixty per<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
cent. of metal, while in some of the veins of ore
native copper was present. Lead ores of over seventy
per cent. of metal are worked to obtain the required
quantity of lead for bullet-moulding, and one lead
ore which was sent me for assay contained a little
over ten per cent. of silver. In the Sher Darwaza
Heights is a vein of copper ore which runs throughout
its length, outcropping here and there, but it is
a thin seam and rather poor in metal, as compared
with other ores round about, but the percentage is
enough to pay handsomely for its working. In other
parts of the mountains round Kabul, however, are
veins of copper ore of sufficient extent and richness
to supply the requirements of Europe for several
years, and if the country was thoroughly prospected,
it is probable that the existence of still further deposits
would be revealed.</p>

<p>The people of the country are very chary of
giving information of the existence of ores in their
locality, fearing that if such are known to exist, the
Amir will have the mines worked, and then the
people of the neighbourhood will be pressed to labour
on them, and as that means taking them away
from their fields and crops to work hard and long on
a small pay, the prospect does not appeal to them.
Should the Amir decide to take advantage of the
mineral wealth of his country, this is what would
happen, no doubt; but, for some unknown reason, the
Amir prefers that these mines, of the richness of
which he is cognisant, should remain unworked; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
yet he appointed several sappers and miners to prospect
the whole of the country and bring in samples
of all rocks, etc., which had the appearance of being
of value and were different in colour and weight to
the common rocks and earth; and these men were
placed under me, and I had orders to go over the
samples they brought in and assay and report on
those which contained metals. From this I gathered
the impression that the Amir eventually intended
working the mines, but up to the time I left the
country nothing had been said or done to this end.
The lead ores are worked for the use of the Government,
and the Amir has proved that his people are
sufficiently intelligent to learn and carry out any
work taught them, and he had sufficient confidence
in my report on ores to send the lead-smelting men
to work on another ore which I recommended when
that of the old working ran out, so that it is difficult
to understand why the exploitation of the mines is
not put in hand; but I have sometimes thought that
the Amir perhaps fears the cupidity of his powerful
neighbours, should he by working the mines of his
country give practical evidence of its richness, and
thereby lose it.</p>

<p>The people of Turkestan, when speaking of the
richness of their country in mineral wealth, claim
that it is much more wealthy than the rest of
Afghanistan, but no ores from that country were
sent to me for assay. One Turkistani chief brought
with him, when on a visit to the Amir, an ore which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
he said contained gold, but it turned out to be iron
pyrites. This chief is not the only man who has
made that mistake, for ores of iron pyrites exemplify
the old saying that all is not gold that glitters. At
Durrah-i-Yusef, in Turkestan, a seam of coal outcrops
in the valley, but it is new coal or lignite.
The seam has been described to me as some six feet
in thickness, and of considerable extent. There are
many uses to which this coal could be put, and
several tons of it were brought to Kabul to try as
fuel in the boiler-house instead of wood, and the
experiment was successful; but the cost of carrying
the coal by camels over the intervening ranges of
mountains, a three weeks’ journey, was prohibitive.</p>

<p>The question of obtaining fuel for the boilers in
the Kabul workshops has lately become of urgent
importance, for the trees of the country up to several
days’ journey from Kabul have been used up, and
further fuel is barely obtainable, while the young
trees which have been planted in places for a future
supply of fuel will not be ready for cutting for eight
years or more to come. In an effort to remedy
matters, the present Amir, a year or so ago, issued
a proclamation offering a large reward to any one
finding coal near to Kabul. The reward was to be
thirty thousand rupees for coal found within five
miles of the city, twenty thousand rupees within ten
miles, ten thousand within twenty miles, and so on.
But there was one stipulation, and that was, that
the coal found should be so located that a road<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
could be constructed up to within a mile of the
mine for wheeled traffic, otherwise the amount of
reward would be reduced in proportion to the distance
from the mine to which carts could be brought.
The proclamation resulted in the country for many
miles around being very thoroughly prospected by
the people, and although very few of them had ever
seen coal, they eventually found thin seams outcropping
in several places, which evidently belonged
to one original bed or field of coal before subterranean
disturbances dislocated the sub-strata around.
I was sent to inspect and report on these outcrops,
and found that it was new coal in such thin seams
that the yield would not repay the cost of working,
and borings failed to reveal the existence of thicker
seams within easy reach below. A gang of my men,
who were appointed to search further afield, found
thick seams of new coal at Sheikh Ali, some six
days’ journey from Kabul towards Hazara, and
further outcrops were discovered at other places on
the same range of mountains; but in this case also
the intervening mountains made the cost of camel
transport far too expensive for the Government to
take advantage of the find, and the Amir is strongly
prejudiced against anything in the way of tram or
light railways, which would be the only way of
carrying coal thence cheaply.</p>

<p>It is more than probable that the Kabul workshops
will have to close soon for want of fuel to
keep the machines running, and the Amir told me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
shortly before I left Kabul, that the local supply
of wood is exhausted, and that there is little likelihood
of coal being found near enough to be of
value. The last winter I spent in Kabul, wood was
so scarce that it realized three times the price of
five years before, and there was very little to be had
even at that price.</p>

<p>From the indications given, it seems probable
that good coal lies under the valley of Kabul; but
the late Amir pronounced the coal-boring work I
commenced as mad-headed, and wanted to know
what was the advantage of making known the existence
of coal many hundred feet below the surface,
for who could get coal from the bowels of the earth,
which were full of water, as the wells about proved.
This he said in durbar, and not to me, so I had no
chance of vindicating my action in the matter. To
me he simply wrote that he wished the men who
were employed on that work to be sent about the
country to see if coal could not be found on the
hillside, as it was in Turkestan; and it was not my
duty to dispute a definite order, nor was the Amir
the kind of man to listen had I done so, for he would
never acknowledge himself in the wrong after forming
an opinion.</p>

<p>The religion of the Afghans is the Mussulman, or
Mahomedan religion, as it is more generally called
in Christian countries, and if the people were to act
up to the tenets of their religion, as taught by the
Koran, then a good Mussulman would be a good
man, for it is as a rule the people who practice
a religion who bring credit or discredit on it. There
are two sects of this religion in the country, the
Shiah and the Suni. The latter sect includes the
royal family and the bulk of the people, while
the Shiah sect is chiefly composed of the Kuzilbash
people, who are the descendants of Persians.
These Kuzilbash live in the south-west portion of
Kabul, called Chindawal, and form a small colony
of their own; but a great number of them live
in Kandahar and Herat, and near the Persian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
frontier. The difference between these two sects
appears to be more in form of ritual than in any
real difference in belief; but there is, however, a
great deal of ill-feeling between them, and this leads
at times to much bloodshed, much as it used to in
days gone by between those of the Roman Church
and Protestants.</p>

<p>The moullahs, or priests, are those who are
brought up in the musjids, and who understand the
Koran, or at least can read it in the old Arabic,
in which language only is it allowed to be written.
They live a holy life of constant prayer combined
with a good deal of fasting, and their beads, similar
to the rosary beads, are always in their hands.
While walking or sitting, or even carrying on a
conversation, these beads are rapidly slipped between
the finger and thumb as they repeat the name of
God for each bead so handled. The sight of a kafar,
and all who are not Mussulman are infidels, is so
obnoxious that they spit on the ground when passing
him in the street, and to kill one of them is quite
a meritorious action in their eyes. The majority
of the people are equally fanatical, and they also
consider it no sin to lie to or swindle a kafar.</p>

<p>The influence the moullahs exert over the people
is very great, and they have little trouble in getting
them to join in the Jihad or holy war against the
enemies of their religion. They argue that the
enemy of their religion is the enemy of God and
therefore a loathsome thing, and that the Koran<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
commands them to kill all such, and promises that
if they are themselves killed in doing so, they shall
go straight to Paradise, and that the man who fails
to kill a kafar, but suffers death himself in the
attempt, has only a little less rank in heaven than
the one who succeeds.</p>

<p>The moullahs also teach that in Paradise good
Mussulmans shall lie in the shade of gold and
silver-leafed trees, whose fruits are precious stones,
with beautiful houri around attending to all their
desires, and with rivers of milk and honey flowing
past them; and in this Paradise, if they desire one
of the many beautiful birds which sit singing in
the trees about, it is instantly placed ready cooked
before them, and when they have eaten, the bird
will assume its former shape and fly back to the
branches above, for there is no taking of life in
Paradise. There is enough in this picture of future
happiness to fire the desire of the average Afghan,
for his life is generally one long struggle for existence.</p>

<p>The Koran is always kept and handled very
reverently, and when not in use it is wrapped in
several cloths, and the person who intends reading
it washes his hands before taking it out of its
wrappings. The Koran is written in Arabic only,
and when I wondered why it was not translated by
competent moullahs into Persian, so that all who
could read might understand, I was told that the
language of the Koran was such that no one could
copy or imitate it, and therefore any translation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
must necessarily be full of errors, and the word of
God violated. For this reason also, those who read
it are taught to pronounce each word exactly, for the
short vowels are not written in Arabic, and it would
be easy for a beginner to wrongly pronounce a word,
because there are many words which are similarly
written and differ only in the pronunciation of the
unwritten short vowels, and therefore the meaning
would become confused, and they say that there is
no greater sin than misconstruing the words inspired
by God. Very few, with the exception of the
moullahs, can read the Koran, and the latter
apparently give very free translations when it suits
their purpose; such, for instance, as that of killing
unbelievers, on which is built up the principles of
Jihad, holy war, and the Amir has had printed
in pamphlet form and distributed throughout the
country of late. I have been assured by Mussulmans
of other countries that the meaning of the Koran has
been twisted in this, for true Mussulmans are exhorted
in the Koran to live with unbelievers for
neighbours in such manner that all may know them
for good and upright men, and when the time comes
to fight against them, then to fight to the utmost of
their power.</p>

<p>The late Amir, who distrusted the moullahs, as
he had reason to do, for on more than one occasion
they caused the people to rise against him by proclaiming
that he did not act up to his religion and
was therefore a kafar, always treated them in such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
manner as to lower them in the eyes of the people
rather than give them honour and uphold their
influence; and he did not fail to punish them as he
did the rest of the people when they deserved it.
One such case was when the moullahs of a holy
shrine wrote him a petition praying for money to
repair the walls and rooms of the tomb, which were
in a dilapidated condition. A holy grave is usually
surrounded by a building, in the rooms of which the
priests who guard the tomb live. The Amir knew
that this place, in common with others, was much
visited by women ostensibly for prayer, but in reality
to keep assignations made with lovers, and that
many had lovers among the moullahs themselves. A
woman’s prayers usually have her own fruitfulness
for objective, and they are supposed to have greater
virtue at a holy shrine, and, under the circumstances,
it is possible that results in some cases were such as
to encourage this supposition. The Amir accordingly
sent for the moullahs, who were sleek and well-fed
men, and told them that he knew of their iniquities,
and, cursing them, ordered the place to be closed and
the moullahs dispersed.</p>

<p>The present Amir, who has not yet the self-reliance
of his father, treats all moullahs with great
honour, and when he became Amir he sent for them
all and gave them money and robes of honour, and
otherwise treated them with distinction. It was no
doubt politic to do so, for the time was critical; but
they are a rather double-edged weapon, and he may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
find that they can cut both ways should he ever
offend them.</p>

<p>There are many holy men and fakirs in the
country, who are honoured by the people and
treated with great consideration. They are credited
with the power of curing sickness by reciting some
part of the Koran over those who are ill, or by
breathing on the water given them to drink; but
more usually they write a verse of the Koran on a
piece of paper and give it to the sick person to
swallow. Holy graves are also supposed to cast out
sickness, simply by the person living at the grave
until cured, and one of my servants tried this remedy
rather than take English medicine, but died there
on the third day.</p>

<p>Lunatics are said to be God-afflicted, and no one
therefore attempts to control their actions or in any
way interfere with them. They are treated instead
with great deference, and are asked for their prayers
and advice in any difficulty or trouble. Offerings of
food and money are taken them, and they are allowed
to go where they will, and no one will stop them even
if they wander into the Amir’s durbar. One such,
who was known and reverenced all over Kabul, used
to go about with nothing on but a long shirt, and
this was open in front and exposed the chest, and in
the depths of winter a posteen only was worn over
the shirt. I have seen this man on the coldest days
lying asleep on the bare ground in the open, bare-headed
and barefooted. The man’s constitution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
who can stand such privation and live must be an
exceptional one. He used sometimes to go to the
Government stores, which were guarded by sepoys,
and, breaking the padlock from a door, would walk in
and lie down there, and no one dared to interfere
with him; and he would also wander occasionally into
the late Amir’s durbar and give expression to his
opinion of the Amir’s character, which is a thing no
other man could have done and lived to boast of.
When the Amir gave him money he threw it broad-cast
from him, and refused to be propitiated, and he
would at times do this with the food and presents
sent him by other people. He had many followers,
of course, and these waxed fat on the good things
sent their chief, and they copied his ways too, and
tried to perfect themselves in them so that they
might also receive honour, and perhaps, when the
day came, step into their master’s shoes, and live
free from the trials and worries governing other
people.</p>

<p>There are many Sayids in the country; a Sayid
is said to be a lineal descendant of the prophet,
and they are looked upon as people of consequence,
and are respected by others, but this does not
prevent them having to work for their living.
Several worked under me, and I found them superior
to the bulk of the men I came in contact with, and
generally more intelligent, which was, perhaps, the
outcome of generations of trying to be superior to
others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span></p>

<p>A Hafiz is one of those who can recite the whole
of the Koran by heart, and they are employed during
Ramazan, the month of fasting, to recite a portion of
it each evening in the musjids until the Koran is
ended. It takes many days to do this, and the
recital is so apportioned at times as to make it last
until the end of the fast.</p>

<p>The fakirs, or holy mendicants, are a great institution
in the country, as they are indeed throughout
the East. They (men, women, and children) profess
to do no work, but beg for the day’s requirements.
They also profess to take no heed for the morrow, and
to make a point of keeping nothing which is given
them for the next day, but to expend all they receive
from the charitable the same day that they receive
it. They may be seen on the sides of the roads and
bazars with their wooden or copper begging bowls,
suspended by a string round the neck and hanging in
front of them, continuously calling out to the passers-by
for charity. Winter and summer they sit in the
same place all day, but in winter they have a small
iron bowl under their posteens, in which a little
lighted charcoal is kept in order to keep them warm.
The present Amir is much against the mode of life of
these people, and he has those boys whom he sees
upon the road begging, caught and taken to the workshops,
where they are ordered to work, and receive food
twice a day and clothes once a year in lieu of pay.
They are practically kept prisoners in the workshops,
for they are not allowed to go out day or night. So<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
far as benefit to the Government is concerned, they are
useless, for they do nothing but play about and idle
all day. Coercion has no effect on them, and many
of the ustads in the shops who tried to get work out
of them, gave them up at last as hopeless, and from
what I saw of them, they did nothing but spoil good
material when their masters forced them to do anything,
and as they did this with even the simplest
sort of work, it was easy to see that they hoped by
these means to be eventually sent away as useless.</p>

<p>Religious crimes and offences are tried by a jury of
moullahs, under an appointed head, who is chosen from
among themselves. For a capital religious offence
the moullahs can order a person to be stoned to death,
but the sentence must be ratified by the Amir. When
the punishment is to be carried out, the condemned
man, with hands tied behind him and chains upon
his legs, is led along the streets of the city, some of
the moullahs following, and at an appointed place the
first stone is thrown by the chief moullah among them.
The populace, who have joined the throng, and arm
themselves with missiles as they go along, wait until
the moullah throws the first stone, and then they
commence throwing too. The condemned man is
forced on by the shower of stones, which takes more
and more effect on him as it is continued, for the
incessant impact of stones gradually weakens him
with pain, until a place called Siyah Sang is reached.
This is a small hill of black rock, about two miles
out of the city, surrounded by a stony tract of ground,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
and here larger stones are selected and thrown, so that
soon the man is staggering forward feebly, knowing
that where he falls his life will be ended, and
trying to keep on a little longer. Eventually he can
bear no more, or a stone larger than others brings him
to his knees and he falls full length, and then the
hail of missiles increases, some taking small boulders
they can barely lift and heaving them on the man’s
body, and so it continues until a mould is piled
up over him, and there he is left, hidden by the heap
of stones. Death does not always occur at once,
although a man become unconscious when he falls,
and cases have been known of a man living for some
hours after, and dying at last in great agony.</p>

<p>The people are looked after by the moullahs, who
see that they keep to their religion, and examine
them periodically to see if they know their prayers;
and for this purpose a party of them are appointed
by the chief moullah to make occasional excursions
into the bazars and workshops and to the public
gardens about. On these occasions each man they
come across is made to repeat his prayers, and if
he says them correctly he is allowed to go his way,
and his way is usually in the track of the moullahs,
where he helps to swell the mob by which they
are followed, for all those who pass the ordeal like
to see what happens to the next man. The man
who makes a mistake in his prayers, or has forgotten
part of them, is beaten with sticks; but if
the case is a bad one, and the man does not know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
his prayers at all, or those who owe him a grudge
come forward and testify to his not saying them
the stipulated number of times each day, then he is
seized, and, with his face blackened and hands tied
behind his back, is placed backwards on a donkey,
which is led by moullahs through the principal
bazars of the city, with, of course, a large crowd
of men following and making rude jokes at his
expense. The shame and disgrace of this proceeding
is said to have such a lasting effect on the man
as to ensure the due performance of religious observances
in the future, and his friends and relations
for years after ungenerously twit and joke him
about it. I once saw a man, who was vigorously
and arrogantly expressing his opinion on some subject,
interrupted quietly by one of those present to
be asked if he knew his prayers yet; the poor
fellow collapsed, tried to brave it out for a little
while, and then made a rapid exit, followed by
the jeering laughter of his companions. Most
of the Afghans are very susceptible to ridicule,
and too much of it is apt to rouse their worst
passions.</p>

<p>All good Mussulmans are supposed to pray five
times a day, but before doing so they must wash
their hands and feet, that they shall present themselves
for prayer before God in a becoming manner.
I was told that the reason wines and spirits are
forbidden in the Koran is, that a man under the
influence of drink does not fully comprehend what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
he does or says, and therefore his prayers, while in
that condition, would be a sacrilege.</p>

<p>The musjids in Kabul are mostly small ones, and
are usually constructed so that three sides are enclosed
and the fourth side left open, and they are built in
such position that the direction of their length points
to Mecca, in which is the tomb of the Prophet, for it
is in the direction of Mecca that all Mussulmans face
while saying their prayers. One very large musjid,
called the Jumah Musjid, was built by the late Amir,
who issued a proclamation that all those who were good
Mussulmans must bring at least one stone from the
mountains to be used in its construction as their share
of the work. A large quantity of stone was collected
in this way, but the size of the building necessitated
the use of carts and coolies to complete the quantity
of materials required. It is in this mosque that the
people congregate for prayers on festivals, and twenty
to thirty thousand are present at times, so that the
musjid, and the grounds surrounding it, are filled
with men standing, kneeling, and genuflecting all
together in long rows, one behind the other. Here,
too, they congregate for prayer when cholera or other
calamity visits Kabul and makes a long stay, hoping
that their united supplication will have the effect of
averting the calamity.</p>

<p>The month of Ramazan, or fast, entails fasting on
all people from sunrise to sunset for thirty days.
Nothing whatever must pass the lips during this
time, and no one may take snuff or smoke. Very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
young children, and those who are seriously ill, are
exempt, but in the latter case it often happens that
a sick person who is unable to bear the ordeal will
insist upon fasting, and so dies from exhaustion.
The sick person, however, who does not observe the
fast must provide a substitute to do so, and pay the
substitute for such service, and he must also feed
a number of the poor according to his means, and
a moullah must certify that the person’s condition is
such that he is, by religious law, exempt from
fasting. After sunset until the sun rises again the
people may eat anything they desire, and they are
not limited to quantity. It is usual for a big gun to
be fired at sunset as a signal to the people that the
day’s fast is over, and many of them have food or
their pipes ready to hand, awaiting the signal which
allows them to break their fast or take a pull at the
pipe, for which the day’s abstinence has created so
keen a desire. An hour or so before sunrise another
gun is fired to warn those people who have to work
the following day that they must wake and eat while
there is yet time to fit themselves to bear the next
day’s fast. The common practice for those who are
able to do it is to turn night into day and sleep
during the daytime, and eat and work at night. In
the Government offices and factories the working
hours are shortened, and men commence work late
in the day and finish early. During the first part of
the month the men seem to bear their fasting cheerfully,
but afterwards the effect of long abstinence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
during the day, followed by a surfeit of food begins
to tell in the way of indigestion and dyspepsia, and
tempers get short and quarrels become frequent.
Many people get very ill, and not a few die, for more
is eaten during the month of fast than any other month,
and the people save up all they can against the time,
when, after being deprived for hours of all they desire,
they can at last eat, drink, and smoke to satiety, and
a heavy meal on a stomach which has long been empty
is not conducive to good digestion. Those who are
heavy smokers, or in the habit of taking snuff, are
those who feel the abstinence most, and to them the
time seems to pass more slowly than it does to others.
Many men have confessed to me how weary are the
hours until the gun announces sunset, and I think all
smokers will sympathize with them. The mirzas
(clerks) are among those who miss their pipe and
snuff most, for they are, almost without exception,
inveterate smokers. The Mussulman year is reckoned
according to the lunar months, and the month of
fasting, therefore, comes at an earlier date each year;
and when it comes in the summer-time, when the
days are long and the weather hot, thirst has to be
added to the other discomforts, and, as almost all
people in Kabul are in the habit of drinking water
frequently during the day, the desire to relieve their
thirst becomes almost unbearable, and they say it is
the worst suffering of all during the fast.</p>

<p>Six weeks following the Eid of Ramazan, the day
of festival which concludes the month of fast, is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
great Eid-i-Kurban, or Feast of Sacrifices, and on
this day all men, no matter how poor, see that they
have new clothes to put on; and should a man be so
poor that he cannot do so, he spends the day alone
in his house, unable to face his friends, shamed and
miserable. It is rare, however, that a man is so
situated, for it is the custom to make provision
against this day, and, at the worst, old clothes can be
mended and cleaned, and made to look good enough
to pass muster, for it is not all who can afford to buy
clothes first-hand. On this festival, after the prayers
in the great musjid which the Amir and princes,
together with their officials and the officers of the
army attend, a review of troops is held on the large
plain facing the mosque. The arrival of the Amir
with his suite on the review-ground is greeted with a
salvo of forty guns, and the review proceeds; but as
it simply consists of the Amir riding past all the
regiments drawn up there, and making them a short
speech, it is soon ended, and then the regiments are
marched back to their barracks, while the roads en
route are crowded with people to watch the tamasha,
not the least of which is the passing by of the Amir
with his retinue and bodyguard, and preceded by the
State elephants decked with gaudy trappings. The
people afterwards spend the day in visiting their
friends and wishing the compliments of the season to
each other; and as it is customary for those visited
to offer their guests tea and refreshments on such
occasions, the cost of doing so is a heavy tax on most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
of them; but it must be done if a man wishes to
retain his respect among his fellows, even though he
gets into debt thereby.</p>

<p>On Shab-i-barat, a festival similar to our All
Souls, fireworks in the evening are the order of the
day, and men invite their friends to have food with
them, and afterwards witness the firework display,
and this is followed in the wealthier houses by music
and dancing-girls, when the entertainment is kept up
until a late hour at night. When a man invites
another to dinner in the evening, it is understood
that the guest shall stop the night, and, as it is only
on special occasions that guests are invited, the proceedings
are always kept up until late. On the
night of Shab-i-barat it is believed by the people
that the souls in purgatory are visited by angels in
order that their papers may be examined to see how
much longer they are to stop there, and to release
those whose time is up and take them to Paradise.</p>

<p>Pilgrimages to Mecca, or the Haj, as it is called,
are undertaken by those who are religiously inclined,
and can afford the time and expense incurred. To
the Afghan the Haj is a great undertaking, and the
chances of return from so perilous a journey are
looked upon as very small, so those who undertake
the pilgrimage do so more or less convinced that
they will never return, and therefore make their wills
and settle up their affairs in the same manner as they
would do so on the approach of death; for foreign
countries inhabited by enemies of their religion and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
therefore of themselves have to be traversed, and
should they get through this ordeal safely, there is
still the sea with its storms and other perils to be
faced. They have many queer legends of the sea
and its inhabitants, some of which will swallow up a
ship when they come across it; and a man needs to
be thoroughly infatuated with the desire to undertake
the holy pilgrimage before he would dare face
all the terrors and dangers which have to be encountered.
When, however, after safely passing
through the perils of the journey, the pilgrim finally
returns, entitled to the distinction of being called
“Hadjee” for the rest of his days, his friends and
relations make much fuss and rejoicing over his
return, and for many months after he does little else
but relate his travels and adventures, and the sights
he has seen, to an eager crowd of listeners, who never
seem to weary of hearing all that there is to be told
them. I have heard some of them relate their experiences,
and I must say their stories do not lose in
the telling.</p>

<p>The Afghans are not great travellers, for their
rulers do not offer facilities for them to visit other
lands, nor do they encourage strangers in the country.
They prefer instead to keep the people isolated, and
out of touch with the rest of the world, and are
fearful that knowledge and enlightenment would
lessen their hold on their subjects, who would be
less easily swayed in the direction they wished when
invoked in the name of their religion were they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
conversant with the laws and customs of the people
of other countries, and could thereby draw comparisons
for themselves.</p>

<p>In Western Australia, however, is a small community
of Afghans who had been many years in
the colony, and do a trade in camel transport across
the sandy desert tracts there. One of these returned
to Afghanistan a few years ago, bringing with him
his English, or rather Australian, wife who had
embraced his own religion. She was uneducated,
and could not read or write, and from what she
said about the visions she had, and voices she heard
exhorting her to persevere in the practice of her
new religion, one would imagine that her mind was
rather unhinged. The man had returned to his own
country, wishing to see it again after thirty years’
absence and to be buried in the land of his fathers,
and he brought back a small fortune with him; but
his relations in Kandahar had borrowed so much
and so frequently that he had but little left, and
for this reason he had to leave his own place and
come to Kabul to see what the Amir would do for
him. He lived in a very small house with but one
servant, and his wife was allowed a small sum yearly
from the Government, and that was all they had to
live on. He was very grateful to me for the pipe
and occasional presents of tobacco I gave him, and
often lamented his want of sense in leaving Australia,
where he had all that made life pleasant, but to
which he was unable to return. He spoke English<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
like an Australian, and his language was interlarded
with oaths which sounded queerly from the lips of
a typical Afghan. He died some two years after
his return from heart disease; and the cholera, which
broke out a few weeks later, carried off his wife
amongst other victims, and before she died, one
of his nephews was doing all he could to get her
to marry him that he might share in her pension.</p>

<p>The Afghan colony in Australia wrote a letter
of congratulation to the late Amir on the occasion
of his receiving the title of “Light of faith and
religion,” and sent him at the same time a copy
of the Australian Government’s order forbidding the
immigration of Orientals into the country unless
each one paid a rather heavy poll-tax, and they
asked his help and influence with the Indian Government
to have Afghans made exempt from this tax.
The Amir, who always had an eye to business and
knew that the colonists were wealthy, replied asking
three or four of their headmen to visit him in order
to discuss the matter; but the headmen were loth
to enter the lion’s den, fearing, probably, that they
might not get out of it again, and they therefore
let the matter drop.</p>

<p>Among the Afghans birds and animals are broadly
divided into two classes, “halal” and “haram,” i.e.
those which may be eaten and which may not, and,
generally speaking, the bird or beast which lives on
meat or carrion is unlawful to eat. Those which are
intended for food are killed by having the throat cut,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
and while this is being done the name of God must
be repeated, for otherwise the flesh is haram and
sinful to eat. If a bird is shot, the Mussulman who
fires the gun repeats the name of God as he shoots—so
that if it is shot dead it may be made lawful
eating. When I was out shooting myself, the men
with me would cut the throats of any bird dropped,
repeating meanwhile the prescribed formula, provided
it had the faintest spark of life left in it, and so
make it “halal,” but if the bird was dead when
picked up no one would eat it. If a dog or other
“haram” beast touches any food with its mouth, the
food is defiled and cannot be eaten, but if it is seen
that the animal touches only one part of it, that
portion may be cut away and the remainder eaten.
Although dogs are looked upon as unclean beasts,
they may be handled without defilement, provided
the dog’s mouth is not touched, or does not touch the
person who is handling it; but should the hands or
clothes come in contact with its mouth, the part
defiled must be washed.</p>

<p>Some of the soldiers and poor people, however,
who keep dogs and make great pets of them do not
seem to fear defilement, and in some cases the pet
dog sleeps on the same bed as its master, and is
treated with every kindness. These men are fond of
teaching their dogs to do tricks, and one pet, which
was the property of a sepoy, would feign death, and
beg, and walk on its hind legs, and take a handkerchief
with a copper in it to the tobacco shop in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
bazar and bring back the tobacco, and do various
other tricks. This dog was also trained to carry in
its mouth a short stick, from the ends of which two
small lanterns were suspended, and run at night to
light the way in front of its master.</p>

<p>The people repeat the name of God in all other
things they do besides making flesh lawful. The
workmen before commencing any work, or starting a
new machine, or pouring molten metal into a mould,
say the name of God that a blessing may attend the
work and make it successful. They do the same
before and after eating, and when naming a child,
first they call the name of God in its ear, and then
the one the child is to be known by.</p>

<p>When the wife of an official presents him with a
child, he takes a present of sweetmeats to the Amir
and informs him of the fact, and then asks him to
choose the name that is to be given it. It is
customary for the Amir to name the children of the
officials and those round him, excepting when a
female child is born, for then the Queen-Sultana
chooses the name. On the birth of a son the Amir
gives presents to the father if he happens to be in
favour, or if he wishes to do him honour, for the
birth of a son is a matter for rejoicing. In the case
of a girl, the birth is passed over in silence, for
women are of small account in Afghanistan, and
sometimes the father will not go near the mother for
several days when a daughter is born, in order to
show his displeasure and mark his resentment for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
woman not better acting up to his desires and
wishes.</p>

<p>When one of the Amir’s wives is expected to give
birth to a child, preparations are made for the firing
of guns and fireworks, and the feasting of all and
sundry, in case it is a boy that comes into the world,
but if it turns out to be a girl nothing in the way of
rejoicing happens, and the mother is left to weep
alone in the disappointment of her hopes; for all
women desire and pray for a man child, because then
the father will visit her, and she is made much of,
and everybody else fusses over and congratulates her,
so that she enjoys a small triumph.</p>

<p>Plurality of wives is general among the Afghans.
There are some with one wife only; but that is either
because they can afford no more, or else the wife
is decidedly the “better half,” and resents the bringing
of other women into the house. I have been
told that in all harems there is a never-ending
struggle for supremacy among the different wives,
and that is why charms and love potions and other
magic arts are resorted to by a woman in an endeavour
to concentrate the love of the man on
herself; and this fight for supremacy, together with
jealousy, is one of the chief reasons why poisons
which cannot be detected are in request. I have
myself been asked if I knew of and could obtain a
poison which resembled any ordinary disease in its
effect, and once also I was asked for a charm or
spell which would ensure one being loved, but I had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
neither of these things, although I was offered a
large amount of money for them. A West End
witch would no doubt be able to get together a
large <i>clientèle</i> in Kabul and do a good business.
The Koran is quoted as the authority for a man
having several wives; but there are some, and they
claim to know the Koran, who say it is written that
a man may marry up to four wives <i>if he can love all
equally</i>, and, as this is impossible, it really means that
one wife is ordered. The prophet is said to have
had more than one wife; but in his case it is stated
that, excepting the wife he loved, they were women
without other protection, whom he married to give a
home to.</p>

<p>All Afghans are religious fanatics, and though
their fanaticism may not be always noticeable, it
requires only the occasion to bring it out. Believing
as they do that their religion has replaced Christianity
as Christianity replaced the Jewish religion,
and that God inspires a new religion at different
eras as the advancement of man requires it, and
therefore their own religion, being the latest, is
necessarily the true one, it is not a country where
Christian missionaries would be likely to produce
much effect.</p>

</div>

<p>From the beginning of his reign, it was the policy of
Amir Abdur Rahman to get rid in one way or another
of those men who had much influence in the country,
and could, by attaching to themselves a following,
become a menace to his interests. It was not politic
to do this openly, nor to get rid of many at one time,
but gradually all who were likely to cause him trouble
were disposed of. The last influential man left in the
country was Ghulam Hyder, the commander-in-chief,
and during the latter part of the Amir’s reign he
was often invited to Kabul, but always evaded the
invitation on one pretext or another. He at last
died at his post near the Indian frontier, and invidious
remarks were made when the native doctor, who had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
been his hakeem, and attended him in his last sickness,
was sent for to Kabul, where the Amir raised
him to the rank of colonel, and gave him money and
presents, and generally made much of him.</p>

<p>One of the Amir’s methods of getting rid of those
men who caused him any anxiety was described to me
by one who said he had been appointed to do the
work on several occasions. This man was not a
Mussulman, and it was one evening, after drinking
a good deal of my whisky, that he related his
experiences, otherwise I doubt if he would have had
the courage to say anything about the matter.
Instead of mentioning the man’s name I will call
him Y. Y. said the Amir sent for him late one
night, and asked if he knew a certain man. This
man was of high rank, and on saying that he knew
him, Y. was told to go to the Captain of the Guard,
and get twelve soldiers, as was written in the order
now given him, after which he was to go to the man’s
house and, on the pretext that the Amir wanted him
privately on some urgent business, take him to a
certain part of the old city which is in ruins, and
when he got the man there he was to act according
to instructions which were written on another paper
the Amir gave him. Y. accordingly went to the
man’s house, taking the twelve soldiers with him,
and leaving them outside, went to the inner gate
and waited, as is the etiquette of the country, while
the door-keeper told the master of the house that
Y. wished to see him on some urgent business.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
Receiving permission, he followed the servant up to
the room where the man was sitting, together with
several friends and relations, drinking tea. When the
man saw Y., he called out and asked him to come and
sit by him, and drink tea with them. Y. did as he was
asked, and then whispered in the man’s ear that the
Amir Sahib wanted him on some very important
matter, and it was best that the Amir should not be
kept waiting. The man said he would go into the
harem and tell his family he was going out, and
would not be back till late, but Y. told him not to
delay even to do that, as the Amir was very urgent
on his going at once, and soon they were outside
together. When they got outside the gate the
soldiers surrounded them, and the man wanted to
know why these men came round them, but Y. told
him that the Amir had sent a guard in his honour
for the hour was late, so they went on, the soldiers
walking on both sides, until they came to the bridge
which spans the river, and here they turned to cross
it, for the old part of the city to which Y. had been
ordered to take the man lay in that direction. The
man, however, got suspicious, and asked why they
were going away from the palace, instead of towards
it, and he seemed inclined to break away; but the
soldiers gathered round closer, and Y. made an
excuse that the Amir had ordered them to go that
way, as he did not wish others to see them going
towards the palace, and that they were to re-cross
the river lower down, and reach their destination<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
that way. The man said no more, and they went
on, but when the road led them still further away
from the palace he refused to go further; but on Y.
telling him that it was the Amir’s orders, and perhaps
seeing that it was useless to resist doing as he was
told, he went on with them. When they at last
arrived at a place in the ruins where there was an
old disused well, the soldiers were signalled to seize
the man, who, realizing what was intended, struggled
fiercely, but was eventually overpowered, and held
down on the ground. The officer of the men then
came up and asked what was to be done further, so
taking the paper given him by the Amir, Y. lighted
a match, and after reading it told the officer that the
man’s head was to be severed from the body. The
officer then walked back to his men, taking out his
sword as he went, and while the man was held down,
cut through the throat, and at last finished the job,
but the man’s violent struggles rendered it difficult
to do what was ordered, until a gash had been made
in the throat, and loss of blood weakened him. The
head and body were then cast into an old well, and
earth thrown on top to hide all traces, and they
returned to the palace, and on arrival there Y. went
to the Amir and reported that he had done as was
ordered; the Amir said, “It is good,” and told him
he had leave to go home.</p>

<p>Y. said that night, after going to bed, every time
he shut his eyes he could see the man’s head as it
was when it was at last severed from the body, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
that it was several nights before he could sleep
without starting up again thinking he saw the same
thing. A few weeks after this had happened, the
dead man’s son went to the Amir, and said that Y.
had called for his father late one night, intimating
that the Amir Sahib wanted him, and the two of
them had gone out together, and since then his father
had not been seen. The Amir told him it was true,
but to keep his mind at rest, for his father had been
sent a long journey on a special mission and, God
willing, he would come back. The relatives of men
got rid of in this way, however, soon guessed the
fate of those missing, and for their own sakes kept
quiet lest they too should be taken away and never
return.</p>

<p>The Amir’s object in getting rid of men who
might cause disturbance was not only to prevent
trouble during his own reign, but also to prepare the
way for the peaceful accession of his son to the
throne, and his thoroughness in carrying out all he
did has made it very unlikely that if Ayoob Khan or
Yakoob Khan returned to their country they could
get together a following of sufficient numbers to
cause any serious trouble. It was to prevent
disturbances after his death that the Amir kept all
his sons in Kabul, and put them in charge of various
official departments, instead of making them governors
of different provinces as former Amirs had done, for
that was the cause of the fighting among the sons for
supremacy and rule when the father died, because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
each son as the governor of a province had money and
an army to help him in a struggle for the throne,
and as each brother wanted it a good deal of fighting
always ensued, and caused much bloodshed and misery
in the country from time to time.</p>

<p>The history of Afghanistan shows how brother
fought brother, and sons their father, one killing or
blinding the other in a fierce desire to rule supreme,
and the foresight of the Amir prevented a repetition
of these horrors on his death. When that occurred
there was no one but Sirdar Habibullah who had any
chance as a candidate for the throne, and having
been the head Sirdar for many years, and having
also represented his father, who was seldom in good
health, on many official occasions, he was looked upon
by the leading men of the country as the one to
succeed to the throne, and consequently received their
support. This, together with his immediate occupation
of the fortified palace of Arak, whereby he
gained control of the treasury and the stores of
modern arms and ammunition as soon as his father
was dead, made him master of the situation, and there
was no one likely to give him trouble except the
Queen-Sultana, the mother of his half-brother,
Mahomed Omar Khan, who was then about twelve
years of age, and she was at once shut out of Arak,
where she usually occupied the harem-serai built for
the use of the Amir’s chief wife, and had to live in
her private palace, Gulistan serai, which is situated
on the Deh Afghanan side of the city. Here she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
was kept nominally in great honour as the chief wife
of the late Amir, but practically a prisoner, for all
her chief and confidential servants were taken from
her and others in the Amir’s pay sent in place of
them, and no one was allowed to go and see her,
while all entrances to her palace, excepting the
principal gate, were bricked up. The Amir and
Sirdar Nasrullah Khan were particularly urgent in
their orders to Mrs. Daly, the lady doctor in Kabul,
that she should not visit the Queen-Sultana or hold
communication with her, and they apparently feared
that she might be induced to take or send a letter
from the queen to the Indian Government, asking
for aid in placing her own son on the throne; and,
though the Indian Government might not take any
notice of her letter, yet such action might prejudice
the new Amir in their eyes. Also those officials and
army officers who were possessed of any influence, and
were inclined to side with the Queen-Sultana, were
bought over by the new Amir, and were raised to
higher rank.</p>

<p>The army, however, was seething with discontent,
and a rising was feared and indeed imminent; but a
promise, which was afterwards ratified, of an increase
of pay all round kept them from any open act of
insubordination, although there was a good deal of
muttering for a long time, and the soldiers freely
expressed their opinions and said they wanted
any other government but that of the reigning
family. The want of reliance in the Government<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
among the people was shown by open acts of robbery
with violence in different parts of the country, the
like of which had been unknown for many years, and
it expressed the indifference of the people to the
constituted authority. This want of reliance in, or
objection to, the existing Government was further
shown by the attacks on the Europeans resident in
the country, one of whom was shot from behind and
killed by the officer of his escort for a slight so trivial
as to induce a doubt as to whether the man acted
entirely on his own initiative, or had been prompted
by those who hoped thereby to cause complications
with other powers prejudicial to their own
Government.</p>

<p>At the time I left Kabul, the revenue of the
country was barely sufficient to pay for the army,
and it has been for many years gradually dwindling
in amount, and the Amir was in great need of
money. Also no arrangement had been come to
with the Indian Government regarding the continuance
of the subsidy which was paid the former Amir,
and the present ruler, for fear of refusal, dared not
ask for it prior to arrangements being made for the
continuance with himself of the terms of alliance
made with his father. Lord Curzon was insistent in
his requests for the Amir to visit him in Peshawar,
in order to settle all matters in a personal interview;
but with the people in a state of unrest, and so many
matters of importance to the internal government of
the country requiring immediate settlement and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
action, the danger of leaving Kabul at that time was
too great for the Amir to risk. The Russian Government
offered to present him with many field-guns,
rifles, and ammunition, but the offer was declined,
for the Russians are feared and distrusted, and their
encroachment on Afghan territory is greatly resented.
Some of the officials, however, appeared to be in
favour of Russian help, for they said that if the
English Government did not help the country there
were others who would, and there were those who
endeavoured to persuade the Amir into accepting
Russian help.</p>

<p>About this time an Afghan general came in from
the Russian frontier, and it was generally said that he
brought with him two Russians, dressed like Afghan
slave boys, of high family. Nothing was definitely
known of this; but at the time it was said that these
Russians were in Kabul, the Amir went to stop a
week or two at his summer palace at Hindeki, some
six miles south of the city, taking with him none but
a few trusted officials and friends, and it was
peremptorily ordered that while there he was to be
left undisturbed, and no one but those who were sent
for were to go to him. This general afterwards
changed a large amount of Russian money in the
city, and from that time Russian notes could be
bought in the bazar, and as it was the first time since
his accession to the throne that the Amir had stayed
at Hindeki, or any other place except in the Arak
stronghold, and as nothing definite was publicly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
known of what transpired, or indeed anything at all
of what the Amir did while he was at Hindeki, it
was all very unusual, for all that the Amir does,
except when in his harem, is commonly known and
discussed, and a good deal is known of what he
does there.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the Amir’s position for some
time after his succession was a difficult one, and
there are still many elements of danger to be overcome.
He has neither the experience nor self-reliance
of his father, and what he may do in a critical time,
or how he would emerge from the test of danger and
adversity, cannot be forecast; but as the ingredients
which go towards the making of anarchy and rebellion
are not wanting in the country, time will probably
give the answer.</p>

<p>Afghanistan is frequently described as a buffer
state between India and Russia, but it is a buffer
which the rolling forward of either power would
readily crush. The bulk of the people are in a discontented
condition, for with high taxation driving
them from their lands to seek work as coolies, food
yearly growing dearer, and epidemics common, it is
likely enough that they would welcome any change
as a change for the better, and until the Amir has
a grasp on the people equal to that of his father,
an invading power would not have an altogether
combined Afghanistan to contend against, in spite
of the Amir’s widely distributed pamphlets on Jihad.</p>

<p>The Amir, and those with him, rely a good deal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
on Jihad (religious war), which is to be preached
by the mullahs in case an invading army crosses
the frontier, and pamphlets on the subject have
been printed and distributed all over the country.
But as matters now stand, the people, although
extremely fanatical, can hardly be relied on to fight
very vigorously, or for any length of time. The
army is supplied with modern field-guns, rifles, and
ammunition, but, although of a modern pattern,
they are few in number, and are not equal to those
of other countries in range and accuracy. The army
is also wholly untrained as compared with the troops
of the two great powers on either side of them, and
its officers have no more knowledge of modern warfare
than the rank-and-file. It is only in the
natural difficulties offered by the mountainous description
of country to the effective movement of
troops and transport of heavy guns that the Amir
could hope to offer any serious opposition to an
invading army, and it is unlikely that after the
first stand made against the invader they would
risk further battle. They would be more likely to
resort to the guerilla methods common to them,
cutting up small detachments and harassing the
rear and lines of communication; but the larger
the invading army, the less effective would these
methods be.</p>

<p>As a means of keeping unruly tribes in order,
the Afghans are best left to govern themselves.
Their methods of quelling rebellion and disorder are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
more ruthless, and therefore more effective and lasting,
for the description of people dealt with than
are the humane methods of other people. Amir
Abdur Rahman, after killing off the bulk of a
nation (men, women, and children) for rebelling
against his authority, has had the remainder transported
to a distant part of the country, where, rid
of former associations and by intermarriage with
other people, they have lost their old traditions,
and settled down quietly to the new order of things.
Should the English (or other power) occupy the
country, the cost of an army of occupation, which
would be necessary to keep the people in order,
would probably equal that of the Indian army,
until a new generation had grown up, more adaptable
and willing to accept the altered condition of affairs.</p>

<p>If it was intended that the Afghans should be
used as a means of checking Russian aggression, it
would no doubt be better that they were well
supplied with the best modern arms; but on the
other hand, there is always the chance of such arms
being used against the English, for the Afghans
look upon all who are not of their own country and
religion as enemies, and it is unlikely that any
existing treaty would be considered or have the effect
of making them hesitate to take advantage of an
occasion which gave them an opportunity for extending
their country, or of benefiting themselves
otherwise. When the border tribes rose and necessitated
the Tirah campaign, the late Amir had some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
thousands of transport animals collected near Kabul,
at the back of the mountains, and though a rising
on his frontier no doubt necessitated precautionary
measures in case his own interests were menaced,
yet, had the British been driven beyond the Indus
as was expected, and which was reported in the
bazars as accomplished shortly after the rising
started, the temptation to retake the Peshawar
district would perhaps have been a powerful one,
for that district is always claimed as part of the
Afghan territory which was stolen from them by
the British.</p>

<p>Generally the sympathies of the people lie towards
the justice and equality of the British rule,
and this is due mostly to the stories related of the
freedom of life in India by the people who have
lived there; but the authorities deal severely with
those who show a liking for the English, and as
they fear to let any information of their doings
reach the British Government, a spy truly or falsely
convicted of reporting to the English is an offender,
who is summarily and finally dealt with.</p>

<p>The British agent in Kabul, and those with him,
are little better than prisoners, for they see no one,
and cannot themselves mix with the people, and
have to confine their peregrinations to the boundaries
of Kabul. All who are found visiting the British
agent are imprisoned, and many hundreds have been
killed merely on suspicion of giving him reports of
the doings of the Government; and an Afghan spy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
ostensibly doing a trade as a tea-seller, is stationed
on the road opposite the gate of the agent’s house
(the house lies a little back from the road) for the
purpose of noting those who go there, and if any
man passes even within a few yards of the gate, he
is reported to the Kotwal; but the fear of the people
of being seen anywhere near the house is now such
that all give it a wide berth in passing by, and no
man who values his life would dare to be seen talking
to any of the agent’s men whom he met in the bazar.</p>

<p>All this would seem to point to a good deal
happening which is detrimental to the interests of
the British Government which the Afghan ruler fears
may come to their knowledge, but from what I saw
and heard in the country, it is only occasionally that
anything happens which would interest the Indian
Government, and then only mildly. It may be,
however, to prevent news of these occasional happenings
leaking out that the Afghan rulers consider it
necessary to make the people afraid of giving news
of any sort to the enemies of their country; for so
they look upon all those who are not of themselves.</p>

<p>They certainly have occasion to fear their prison
system becoming known publicly, for cruelty of all
sorts is common in the way of torture. Imagine
a prison where the limbs which have been hacked
off men are left lying about, together with the dismembered
bodies of those dead, of the suffering
inflicted on them, until the whole place reeks of
decomposing flesh, and then consider the frame of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
mind of hundreds who are imprisoned without trial,
unknowing of what their own punishment is to be,
who daily live in the midst of these horrors. If
the truth about the Kabul prisons were generally
known, other countries would probably unite in
insisting on such barbarity being stopped.</p>

<p>The common people, who have their own way of
looking at everything, attribute the large numbers of
men killed in prison without any generally known
reason for their execution to the British Government,
and say that as the British were unable to conquer
them by fighting, they now pay the Amir large sums of
money monthly (the subsidy) to kill them in other
ways. The people also say of the Bala Hisar (high
fort) in Kabul, which Lord Roberts rased to the
ground in 1880 after the massacre of Cavagnari and
his men, and which still remains in ruins, that the
Amir has been ordered by the British Government
not to rebuild it, as one of the conditions of his
occupying the throne. The opinion of these people,
however fallacious, is still the opinion of those who
comprise the bulk of the population, and although
they are ignorant and uninformed their opinion ought
not to be altogether neglected.</p>

<p>Amir Abdur Rahman, on one of the occasions
when he favoured me with remarks on political
affairs, told me he had received a letter from one
of his spies in Russia, and he would read it to me.
His object in doing so, of course, was not that he
wished me to keep the information to myself, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
I was leaving for India the following day, and it was
a matter the Amir could not very well make the
occasion of a letter to the Indian Government. The
spy wrote that he had it from a Russian official in
high authority that his Government intended, so long
as Amir Abdur Rahman lived, to leave Afghanistan
untouched, but that after his death they would seize
it; and when the Amir had read this to me he
remarked that if it was true that such was their
intention, although he would be dead when they
endeavoured to take his country, it was, nevertheless,
a matter of importance to him, for he had for many
years been striving to unite and raise his country to
such position that it could hold its own among the
nations and remain always an independent kingdom,
and if at the time of his death his object might not
be altogether accomplished, still, what he had done
would form a foundation on which it was his greatest
desire that his sons and their descendants would build
the wall which was to keep the country intact and
prevent foreign aggression.</p>

<p>On all occasions when Amir Abdur Rahman spoke
to me on such matters he showed that he had the
good of his country at heart, and at times he even
shed tears when he reflected on his failure to imbue
the whole of his people with his ambitions, and that
all his efforts, even punishing and killing to the
extent he had done, failed to induce them to forego
those habits which prevented the union and strength
he prayed for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span></p>

<p>On the occasion mentioned above, the Amir
threw some light on his aversion to having railways
in Afghanistan. He said he had powerful neighbours
on both sides of him. Each power was anxious
to extend their railways into his country, and, failing
that, they were always trying to persuade him to
construct them himself for the benefit and improvement
of his people. But supposing he did as they
wanted and laid railways over his country, then they
would point out that unless his system communicated
with theirs they would be of little advantage to him,
and he himself could see that too. And then if he
joined up his railways with one power, the other
power would claim a like concession and he would
have to give it to risk friction and war, and yet
England as his ally would expect to be the only one
so favoured. Therefore, he said, it is better that the
country should go without railways, however much
it loses in its trade and development by so doing.</p>

<p>Amir Abdur Rahman never favoured me with
any remarks which would throw a light on his
apparently culpable neglect in working the rich mines
of his country. Instead, he often mentioned the benefit
to his country which the working of these mines
would occasion, and soon after my appointment he
gave me written orders to build the necessary works
for smelting the copper ores which have been found
in the neighbourhood of Kabul. When the work
was about half completed, however, he sent instructions
to me to postpone work on it until further<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
orders, and thereafter let the matter rest in abeyance,
so that the work still remains uncompleted. He
avoided any mention to me of his reason for stopping
a work on which he had been so keen to begin, and
it can only be supposed that he was fearful of adding
an incentive to interference with his country on the part
of his neighbours by showing the riches it contained.</p>

<p>Amir Habibullah, who follows his father’s policy
in all things, has done nothing towards developing
the resources of the country beyond ascertaining the
position and value of its various mineral deposits.
Amir Habibullah is, however, desirous of obtaining a
strip of country from the west of Afghanistan to the
coast on the Beloochistan side, in order to obtain a
seaboard which would enable him to deal direct with
other countries and obviate the necessity of going
through the territories of his neighbours—permission
for which depends always on their goodwill. With
such a seaboard they would be independent, could
develop the country, and sell the produce of their
mines and other exports direct, and with the proceeds
of such trade could import whatever war
material or other goods they required, and strengthen
themselves without the knowledge of or interference
from their neighbours.</p>

<p>The Afghan rulers have spies and others in India
as well as in European countries who give them information
on all subjects which affect Afghanistan
either directly or indirectly, and the Amir and his
intimates take the utmost interest in the doings of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
those who rule the destinies of other nations, and
they watch all that goes on between the different
powers. But, excepting these few in authority, the
people are shut off from news of the outer world, for
there are no newspapers in the country, and the
newspapers of other countries they are unable to
read; and as their Government objects to foreigners
entering the country and allows none such to do so except
on business, and then only by special permission
from the Amir, and as very few of their own people are
allowed to travel on business across the border, the
bulk of the Afghans are ignorant of everything except
that which happens within their own limited sphere.</p>

<p>The Afghan rulers also in their conduct of the
internal affairs of the country make a point of keeping
it secluded and out of touch with the other
countries around them, and British officers who have
crossed the border either knowingly or otherwise,
have been made prisoners and kept so until the
Amir’s orders were received. The intercourse of the
people with other nations would no doubt tend to
civilize them, and by broadening their views do
away with much of their present fanatical prejudice
against all other people, which is due principally to
the secluded life they are forced to lead, practically
cut off from the rest of the world. It is this thought
which directs the policy of seclusion of their rulers,
for they make a practice of working upon the ignorance
and religious superstition of the people to
influence them in any required direction.</p>

</div>

<p>After several years spent in Kabul, one experiences a
sense of elation when the time comes for leaving it.
The thought of being back soon in civilization, among
one’s friends and the people of one’s own country,
produces so keen a desire to be with them again at
once that the time occupied in making ready to start,
and that spent on the journey, seems interminable.
When in Kabul there is a remoteness in the thought
of home and England so great that the memory
seems to deal with the land and people of another
planet, and if one were a Buddhist it might easily be
conceived that the memory dealt with a former incarnation,
for one is so cut off from the outer world,
and all things are so different, that it appears like a
separate existence.</p>

<p>Afghanistan is a difficult country to get into, for
not only is the Amir’s written permission necessary,
but the Indian Government must consent also, for no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
European is allowed to go through the Khyber Pass
and cross the frontier without a permit, and that is
only granted on producing the Amir’s firman; and
even then one is not allowed to start until the
Afghans across the frontier have been communicated
with and the escort arranged to meet the traveller on
a certain day. It is also difficult to leave it, for the
Amir is chary of giving leave to those who have
spent some time in the country. I was there for over
eight years without a break, and although I repeatedly
asked for leave I was always put off on one pretext or
another. When permission to leave has been given
there always occurs another two or three weeks’ delay
in getting together the pack-horses required for carrying
luggage, and the escort of sowars (cavalry)
necessary for protection on the journey, and the tents
and carpets, etc. With a desire to start as soon as
ever possible, the casual to-morrow-or-next-day habit
of the people, to which one has got accustomed more
or less, becomes of a sudden a prominent characteristic,
and proportionately irritating. But as all things
come to those who wait, provided they wait long
enough, everything is at last ready, and one morning
all the boxes and packages are fastened on the backs
of the pack-animals, the servants are seated on those
horses which carry the lightest loads, and the baggage
is got off, and an hour or two later one mounts and
starts off one’s self.</p>

<p>It is an eight days’ journey from Kabul to
Peshawar if long marches are undertaken each day,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
but the people who travel up and down that way
usually take eleven or twelve days. I have done
it in six days, but to do it in this time all the
riding and pack-horses must be of the best, for the
mountainous country traversed, and rough stony
character of the tracks (there are no roads excepting
round Kabul itself), make it very trying for the
horses, and on a very long day’s march some will
drop from fatigue, and cases of horses dying on
the road are not at all uncommon.</p>

<p>When the valley of Kabul has been left behind
the country appears very desolate, for there is nothing
but mountains, rocks, and sand to be seen. The
second day’s journey takes one over the Latabund
Pass which lies at a considerable altitude above
Kabul, which is itself seven thousand feet above
sea-level, and the rest of the journey until Jelalabad
is reached is all over mountains. Camp for the
night is pitched near small villages set in valleys
where a little water makes the cultivation of a few
patches of sandy soil possible. It is the very small
amount of rainfall which makes the country so barren
generally for the disintegrated rock which collects
in the valleys, and the foot of the mountains forms
a prolific soil when it can be irrigated, and it is
also the want of verdure and trees on the mountains,
and absence of clouds with their accompanying haze
of moisture, which is the cause of the monotonous
colouring of the landscape, for there are many fine
mountain scenes which would be magnificent, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
for the dryness of the atmosphere which makes the
hills and mountains, far and near, shades of one
dirty looking colour. At the beginning of a day’s
march, the sameness of the prospect makes one almost
sigh at the dreary stretch of country to be ridden
over, for it offers nothing of interest to lessen the
sense of fatigue, and the only desire while riding
is to get it done with, and look forward to the
camping-place.</p>

<p>The usual stopping-places between Kabul and
Jelalabad, which is about halfway to Peshawar, are
Budkhark, twelve miles; Barikab, thirty-two miles;
Jagdalak, sixteen miles; Gandamak, twenty-eight
miles; Fatehabad, eighteen miles; and Jelalabad,
nineteen miles. These distances are only approximate,
for they are estimated from the time occupied in
riding from one to the other. There are other places
at which one may camp for the night if necessary,
according to the number of days in which it is
desired to make the journey; but the above are best
if one wishes to make each day’s journey equal in
fatigue for the horses and pack-animals. The shorter
marches are over bad mountain tracts, which tire the
horses quite as much as a longer journey over fairly
level country. The sixth day’s journey to Jelalabad
is over ground which slopes down gradually from
the foot hills, but almost the whole of it is through
sand mixed with small stones in which the horses’
feet sink deeply, and makes the going hard and
tiring. Those who have walked any distance in dry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
sand by the seashore will appreciate the fatigue of
the horses in getting over such country.</p>

<p>When I left Kabul snow was falling, and had
been doing so for the past two days, and the
mountains and plains were covered with it, and to
make matters worse a blizzard was blowing. The
coldness of a blizzard must be experienced to be
appreciated, and I heard afterwards that two or three
soldiers on night-guard had been frozen to death; but
this is a common occurrence during the severe winters
experienced in Kabul, when the wind gains in piercing
intensity as the cold increases during the night.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>THE SERAI AT JAGDALAK, ON THE ROAD FROM
  KABUL TO PESHAWAR.</p>
  <p class="right">[<i>To face p. 312.</i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After riding through the snow for some hours,
with limbs stiffened and senses benumbed by the
icy wind, it was with a feeling of thankfulness that
I saw the walls of the serai, showing through the
driving snow; and when we reached the place and
dismounted, I found that the circulation in my right
hand had stopped, and it was only after having it
rubbed for some time that it got right again. The
serais, which are stationed at intervals along the
route, are intended for the use of the caravans, and
they are made in the form of a square, with a high
wall surrounding it, and the rooms are built against
the inner side of the wall. There is a verandah outside
the rooms, under which the packages carried by
the caravans are stored for the night in bad weather,
and which also forms a shelter for the camels and
pack-animals. Over the gate of the serai, in which
we lodged for the first night, was an upper room,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
built for the use of travellers of position and standing,
and this was placed at my disposal; but as regards
its comforts, I can only say that it was better than
being outside. One of the lower rooms which are
used by the men of the caravans travelling up and
down would have been warmer, but they are filthy,
and mostly contain a vigorous population undesirable
to those of clean habits; and the room I occupied
was fairly clean, but it was unfurnished, and had
no fireplace, while the window was composed of
wooden shutters, and round the frame were cracks
an inch wide, where the wood had shrunk away from
the wall and left open spaces, and in the wall itself
were large cracks, due probably to earthquakes,
through which the wind whistled; so while waiting
for the baggage to come up, I had an open fire
lighted on the top of the verandah outside, and
warmed myself one side at a time. It was not until
night had fallen that the baggage animals came in,
and I was able to get a cup of hot tea, and an hour
or two later I got some food, and it was rather a
dreary time waiting for it, when tired and hungry,
and the thermometer below zero. To undress and
go to sleep with the blizzard blowing in at all the
cracks in wall and window was not to be thought
of, so I took off my boots only and lay down,
covering myself with all the rugs I had; and in the
morning when I woke, I found that the water in
the wash-basin was frozen solid, and fine drift snow
covered the floor and bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span></p>

<p>The morning was clear and bright, and the
dazzling whiteness of the snow in the sunlight was
blinding, until the eyes became a little used to it;
but the wind continued in all its severity, and while
riding over the Latabund Pass, we found it far too
cold at that altitude to sit in the saddle with
comfort, for our hands and feet became so numbed
and useless that we feared frostbite, and therefore
the escort and myself dismounted and walked, in
order to keep ourselves warm, and led our horses,
until about two o’clock in the afternoon, we reached
the summit. Once on the other side of the pass,
we were protected from the wind, but I thought
it still too cold to ride, and so walked on the rest
of the way to Barikab, where I reached camp at
six in the evening, very tired with a long day’s
walk. The pack animals, which are too heavily laden
to take the short cuts over the mountains that
the riding horses follow, did not reach camp until
nine o’clock, so that it was again very late before
I got my dinner, and by the time I got it I
wanted it.</p>

<p>Thence to Jelalabad, as each successive range of
mountains brought us still lower down it got warmer
day by day, but the warmth was comparative only,
for it was still very cold when we reached Jelalabad.
Here I spent a day, having a day extra in hand
in which to reach the Khyber Pass, which is open
for travellers twice a week only, and occupied myself
in looking over the city and inspecting the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
Amir’s palace and gardens there. The city is a
small one, and is walled round, as usual, but the
wall is broken down in places, and everything has
a most dilapidated look, and many parts are in
ruins. There is no attempt to keep the city clean,
and the inhabitants of each house make their own
sanitary arrangements, which practically means none
at all, as each one throws the refuse of the house
outside to lie there and rot, if not eaten up by the
dogs and crows. The water of the place stinks,
and it is not at all surprising that when cholera
visits it, being brought up from India with the
caravans, it makes a long and effective stay. One
wonders that it does not wipe off the whole of the
population, but the dry climate and frequent winds,
no doubt, help towards the sanitary condition of
the city, and perhaps long-continued successive visits
of cholera have made many of the people immune.</p>

<p>It was in Jelalabad that I first saw the Usbeg
game of “Buz-bazee” (literally, “goat play”). It is
played on horseback, and the first thing done is to
kill a goat or sheep by cutting its throat in the usual
manner while the Usbeg horsemen gather around.
When this has been done, a signal is given, and all
the riders make a dash at the carcase, which lies on
the ground. The man who gets it flings it across the
saddle in front of him, and goes off at full gallop,
the others chasing him until one or another catches
him up, and then ensues a struggle, while still at
full gallop, for the possession of the body. The man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
who gets it is chased in turn by the others, and
when the carcase falls to the ground, as it does at
times, it is picked up as the rider gallops by, the
horseman riding with one leg and arm thrown over
the horse to enable him to reach low down to the
ground. So the game goes on until the limbs are
wrenched apart and the victors ride off at last with
the portion they have been able to secure, and which
the speed and agility of their horses prevents others
from taking from them.</p>

<p>The usual journey from Jelalabad to Peshawar
occupies five days. Girdi Kutch, the first stopping-place,
is twenty miles; Basawal, eighteen miles;
Daka, the Afghan frontier post, sixteen miles; and
Lundi Kotal, the British frontier post on the far side
of the Khyber Pass, twenty miles. The last day’s
journey is from Lundi Kotal through the Khyber
Pass, and past Jumrood, the fort which guards the
mouth of the Khyber on the Indian side, and on
into Peshawar, where one enters once more into
civilization.</p>

<p>From Jelalabad to the Khyber mountains the
country is a comparatively flat one, and for the
greater part of the journey the route follows
the course of the Kabul river, which is here broad
and shallow, though the current is swift, on account
of the considerable fall in level between Jelalabad
and Peshawar. This portion of the river contains
several whirlpools, which render navigation a matter
of difficulty and danger to all who are not well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
conversant with the currents. The whirlpools are
said to be mostly situated in the narrow gorges of
the Khyber mountains, through which the river flows,
and that it is here where the skill of the raftsmen
is called into play to prevent sudden disaster, for
the swiftness of the current gives little opportunity
of correcting a mistake in steering.</p>

<p>Jelalabad is one of the few spots in Afghanistan
where there are many trees. The forests are situated
some few miles from the city, and may be seen
covering some of the hills in the distance. The
timber, a description of the pine tree, after being
cut down, is roughly squared into logs and dragged
down to the river, where they are formed into rafts
and floated down into Peshawar for sale. A small
amount of produce is also carried on the rafts and
sold in India.</p>

<p>On one of my journeys down to Peshawar the
governor of Jelalabad, by order of the Amir, sent me
several large melons which are grown in the district.
The size of the melons was so great, about two feet
long and one and a half feet in diameter, that I had
no means of carrying them with me, and on this being
represented to the governor, he gave instructions for
them to be carried by raft into Peshawar and handed
over to me there. The raftsmen told me that they
would be in Peshawar twelve hours after leaving
Jelalabad, and as the distance between the two points
is about a hundred miles, some idea of the speed of
the current may be gained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span></p>

<p>The water of the river is fed by the melted snow
from the mountains, and is intensely cold, and I was
told that any one who attempted to swim across the
river would be carried so far down by the current
before reaching the other side that the coldness of the
water would make him numbed and powerless, and he
would drown. The people of the district, when they
have to cross the river, do so on musaks distended
with air, which keep the body clear of the water,
while allowing the use of the legs and arms as a
means of propulsion; but even then the limbs get so
numbed and paralyzed that only strong men can make
use of the musak as a means of crossing the river, or
floating down to another village some miles lower on
the same side; and I was told that the frequent use
of it brings on rheumatism in the legs and arms—and
one can quite understand that it would do so.</p>

<p>The musak is the same as that used by watermen
all over the East for carrying water. It is made of a
goat or sheepskin, which is treated to make the skin soft
and flexible, and afterwards sown up, so that it has
the original form of the animal, minus head and legs;
the joints are made watertight, and the whole skin
when distended by air being blown into it forms a
very buoyant vessel. The villager lies face downwards
on it, and pushing off into deep water, strikes
out with arms and legs, much as if he was swimming,
and those I have seen travelling down the river in
this way were going at a speed which I estimated at
a good ten miles an hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span></p>

<p>Close to Jelalabad, where the river narrows as it
runs between some low hills, the villagers have
stretched a thick rope across from bank to bank,
fastening it to large iron bars fixed in the rocks at
the side, and by means of this rope they ferry a
rickety-looking raft, which is built up of frail-looking
poles roughly tied together, and supported on musaks,
from one bank to the other, and carry freight,
passengers, and animals as required. The rope is a
country-made one of unequal thickness, and ragged
with loose strands, and has a good deal of stress
thrown on it by the swift current which surges
against the raft, and swings it from side to side on
its passage, and it struck me that a passenger addicted
to nerves would find the crossing a rather trying time.
I was not surprised to learn that the raft occasionally
broke away with disastrous results to those on it, for
few of the people can swim.</p>

<p>The people of the district once petitioned the Amir
to make a bridge over the river, and to ensure the
free communication which would benefit the people
on both sides, a bridge is badly wanted. The Amir,
who was averse to making any fixed structure
which might benefit some future enemy, decided on
having a pontoon bridge made; but the men he put in
charge of the work being altogether inexperienced,
their efforts were made short work of by the river,
and the idea was abandoned.</p>

<p>I once suggested a scheme to the Amir of taking
advantage of the river for carrying freight between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
the Jelalabad district and India, and such a scheme is
quite feasible; for, by cutting a deep channel in the
wider portions of the river, and blasting away the
rocks which cause the whirlpools and other dangers to
navigation, the journey down to India could be made
easy, and steam tugs could be employed for drawing
barges up on the return journey. At present pack-animals
are used, and the cost of freight every year
is a large item to the Government, and for several
months in the year the heat of the lower country
between Jelalabad and the Khyber, and consequent
high death-rate among the pack-animals, prohibits
the carriage of anything but very necessary articles,
which must be brought up at all costs. The Amir
was at first disposed to have the scheme gone into,
but eventually he let the matter drop, as he did
all schemes which did not offer immediate reimbursement.</p>

<p>The country between Jelalabad and the Khyber
is well cultivated, and there are many villages on
both sides of the river; but a good deal of ground is
allowed to lie idle which could be made profitable,
and the reason for this is, no doubt, that there are
no cheap means of carrying produce for sale in India,
and the people have no incentive to grow more than
is sufficient for their own consumption. The soil is
very productive, and most of the cereals, fruits, etc.,
suitable for a hot climate, grow well. The heat
during the summer months is great, though not so
much so as in the Peshawar district. It is, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
quite hot enough to render riding over that part of
the country a very trying experience; and I remember
when travelling up once in June how my
mouth became so parched that I dare not let my
tongue touch the roof of the mouth, as I was afraid
it would stick there and choke me, and I was ready
to drink from any of the stinking wells we came to,
to get relief. Fortunately there was no cholera
about at the time, or I might have fared worse, for
no thought of disease would have deterred me from
drinking. The temperature is made more trying than
it would be because the rocks absorb the heat of the
sun and become very hot, and the heat given out by
them, together with that of the sun, makes the narrow
defiles here and there feel like ovens, and they are so
stifling that breathing more resembles gasping, until
they are left behind, when the hot wind of the plains
comes as a perfect relief after what has been gone
through. “Like unto the shadow of a great rock in
a dry land” has a fuller meaning to those who travel
in such places.</p>

<p>The route from Kabul to Peshawar is the shortest
and the recognized one for those who travel to
India. There are other roads which might be used to
get there; but even if one had the opportunity of
using them, there are few who would care to prolong
the time spent on the journey by electing to travel
that way.</p>

<p>When the last day’s journey through Afghan
territory brings one at last to the point where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
British territory begins, the line of demarcation is
readily defined. Up to the point where the Afghan
rule extends, one travels over the country as Nature
made it, and the way is strewn with rocks and
boulders, which are allowed to lie in the path, and
necessitate the horses walking round, or in and out
between them, and making them traverse thereby a
much longer distance than a clear road would give.
But from that point where British authority begins,
there is a smooth graded road, which leads one high
up over the hills and mountains of the Khyber to
Lundi Kotal, and thence through the difficult
mountain country of the Pass, and on into Peshawar,
with gradients so easy that one can take a dog-cart
and drive at a sharp trot the whole of the distance,
and cover ground in a few hours which, on the
Afghan side of the frontier, takes a long day’s tedious
riding to get over.</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
